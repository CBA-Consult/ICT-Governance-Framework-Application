# ICT Governance Framework Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic enhancement plan for our ICT Governance Framework based on expert review and comparison against leading industry standards including COBIT 2019, ITIL 4, ISO/IEC 38500, TOGAF, FAIR, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, COSO, and emerging frameworks for AI governance. The plan addresses ten identified enhancement areas while preserving the framework's existing strengths in comprehensive structure, security & compliance, lifecycle management, shadow IT detection, and quantifiable metrics.

The enhancements aim to elevate our ICT Governance Framework to industry-leading status by incorporating best practices from multiple governance and management frameworks, ensuring our organization achieves maximum value from technology investments while effectively managing associated risks and addressing emerging challenges in AI ethics, sustainability, and zero trust security architectures.
