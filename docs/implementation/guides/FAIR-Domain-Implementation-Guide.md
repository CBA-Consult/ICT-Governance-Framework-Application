## FAIR Methodology Overview

### Core FAIR Equation
```
Risk = Loss Event Frequency (LEF) √ó Loss Magnitude (LM)

Where:
LEF = Threat Event Frequency (TEF) √ó Vulnerability (V)
LM = Primary Loss (PL) + Secondary Loss (SL)
```

### Risk Factor Definitions

**Threat Event Frequency (TEF)**: The probable frequency of a threat agent acting against an asset within a given timeframe (typically annual).

**Vulnerability (V)**: The probability that a threat event will result in a loss event, expressed as a value between 0 and 1.

**Primary Loss (PL)**: The direct monetary impact resulting from a loss event, including immediate costs and direct business impact.

**Secondary Loss (SL)**: The indirect monetary impact resulting from a loss event, including reputation damage, competitive disadvantage, and regulatory consequences.

### Risk Assessment Confidence Levels

- **High Confidence (H)**: Based on substantial historical data, industry benchmarks, and expert analysis
- **Medium Confidence (M)**: Based on limited historical data, some industry benchmarks, and expert judgment
- **Low Confidence (L)**: Based primarily on expert judgment and limited data sources
