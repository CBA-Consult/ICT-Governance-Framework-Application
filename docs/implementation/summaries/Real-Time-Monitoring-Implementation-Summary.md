# Real-Time Monitoring and Alerting Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities for compliance violations and security incidents within the ICT Governance Framework. The implementation addresses the critical need for immediate detection and response to governance violations, establishing comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and automated response capabilities.

## Implementation Overview

### Problem Statement
The organization faced delayed detection of compliance violations and security incidents, leading to:
