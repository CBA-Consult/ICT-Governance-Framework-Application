├── Risk Management & Compliance
└── Innovation & Emerging Technology Evaluation

Execution Layer (Technology Stewards)
├── Change Management & Release Control
├── Operational Risk Management
└── Performance Monitoring & Reporting
```

### 1.2 Process Integration Model

All governance processes are integrated through:
- **Unified Governance Platform:** Single system for all governance activities
- **Shared Data Model:** Common data structures across all processes
- **Integrated Workflows:** Seamless handoffs between process areas
