## üéØ Framework Overview

### Core Principles
The ICT Governance Framework is built on these foundational principles:

1. **Unified Governance Platform** - Single pane of glass for all governance activities
2. **Multi-Tenant Architecture** - Support for diverse tenant communities with varying requirements
3. **Cross-Cloud Operations** - Unified governance across AWS, Azure, GCP, and emerging platforms
4. **Automated Lifecycle Management** - Streamlined processes from onboarding to offboarding
5. **Compliance by Design** - Built-in regulatory compliance and monitoring
6. **ISO/IEC 38500 Alignment** - Full implementation of international IT governance standards

### Framework Components

#### Governance Structure
- **Strategic Governance Council** - Executive oversight and strategic direction
- **Tenant Domain Owners** - Domain-specific governance and decision-making
- **Cloud Platform Stewards** - Platform-specific technical governance
- **Tenant Service Managers** - Day-to-day operational management

#### Key Capabilities
- **Policy Management** - Centralized policy definition and enforcement
- **Risk Management** - Comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation
- **Compliance Monitoring** - Real-time compliance tracking and reporting
- **Performance Measurement** - KPI tracking and governance effectiveness

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Governance Teams
1. **Start with Core Framework**: Review [ICT-Governance-Framework.md](core-framework/ICT-Governance-Framework.md)
2. **Understand Multi-Tenant Aspects**: Study [Multi-Cloud-Multi-Tenant-ICT-Governance-Framework.md](core-framework/Multi-Cloud-Multi-Tenant-ICT-Governance-Framework.md)
3. **Review Current State**: Examine [assessment documents](assessment/)
4. **Plan Target State**: Use [target-framework documents](target-framework/)

### For Implementers
1. **Framework Assessment**: Use [assessment tools](assessment/) to evaluate current state
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify improvement areas using [gap analysis documents](assessment/)
3. **Enhancement Planning**: Follow [target framework guidance](target-framework/)
4. **Metrics Implementation**: Deploy [measurement frameworks](metrics/)
