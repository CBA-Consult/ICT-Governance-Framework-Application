## Metric Definitions

### Security Score Calculation
```
Security Score Percentage = (Current Score / Maximum Possible Score) × 100
Trend Direction = Current Score - Previous Period Score
Implementation Rate = (Implemented Controls / Total Controls) × 100
```

### Risk Metrics Calculation
```
Risk Level = (Likelihood × Impact) / Risk Tolerance
Risk Trend = (Current Period Risk Score - Previous Period Risk Score) / Previous Period Risk Score
Critical Alert Threshold = Severity Level >= 8/10
```

### Operational Metrics Calculation
```
MTTD = Average(Detection Time - Incident Start Time)
MTTR = Average(Resolution Time - Detection Time)
SLA Compliance = (Met SLAs / Total SLAs) × 100
False Positive Rate = (False Positives / Total Alerts) × 100
```

### Compliance Metrics Calculation
```
Framework Compliance = (Compliant Controls / Total Framework Controls) × 100
Overall Compliance = Weighted Average of All Framework Scores
Compliance Trend = (Current Score - Previous Score) / Previous Score
```
