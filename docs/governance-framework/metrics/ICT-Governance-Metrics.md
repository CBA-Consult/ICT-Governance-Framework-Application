### Maturity Model

The ICT Governance Maturity Model provides a framework for assessing and improving governance maturity:

| Level | Description | Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **1 - Initial** | Ad-hoc and reactive governance | Undefined processes, inconsistent application |
| **2 - Repeatable** | Basic governance processes established | Processes documented but not fully integrated |
| **3 - Defined** | Standardized governance processes | Processes standardized and communicated |
| **4 - Managed** | Governance processes measured and controlled | Quantitative measurement and analysis |
| **5 - Optimizing** | Continuous improvement of governance | Proactive improvement and innovation |

The organization aims to achieve and maintain Level 4 (Managed) maturity for all governance domains, with specific areas progressing to Level 5 (Optimizing).
