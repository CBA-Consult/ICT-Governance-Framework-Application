## 1. Gap Analysis Methodology

### 1.1 Assessment Framework

The gap analysis employs a multi-dimensional assessment framework based on:

**Industry Standards Benchmarking:**
- COBIT 2019 governance and management objectives
- ITIL 4 service management practices
- ISO/IEC 38500 governance principles
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- FAIR risk quantification methodology

**Assessment Dimensions:**
1. **Current State Maturity** (from A021 assessment)
2. **Industry Best Practice Target** (from A022 benchmarking)
3. **Gap Severity** (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
4. **Business Impact** (High, Medium, Low)
5. **Implementation Effort** (High, Medium, Low)
6. **Strategic Priority** (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

### 1.2 Scoring Methodology

**Gap Severity Calculation:**
```
Gap Severity = (Target Maturity - Current Maturity) × Domain Weight × Risk Factor
```

**Priority Score Calculation:**
```
Priority Score = (Business Impact × 0.4) + (Gap Severity × 0.3) + (Strategic Alignment × 0.2) + (Implementation Feasibility × 0.1)
```

**Priority Classifications:**
- **Critical (9.0-10.0):** Immediate action required (0-3 months)
- **High (7.0-8.9):** Short-term implementation (3-6 months)
- **Medium (5.0-6.9):** Medium-term enhancement (6-12 months)
