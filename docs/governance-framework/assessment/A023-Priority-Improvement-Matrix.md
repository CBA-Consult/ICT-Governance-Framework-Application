## 1. Priority Matrix Methodology

### 1.1 Evaluation Criteria Framework

The Priority Improvement Matrix employs eight key evaluation criteria:

| Criteria | Weight | Description | Scoring Range |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Business Impact** | 25% | Potential impact on business operations and outcomes | 1-10 |
| **Gap Severity** | 20% | Size of gap between current and target state | 1-10 |
| **Strategic Alignment** | 15% | Alignment with organizational strategic objectives | 1-10 |
| **Risk Mitigation** | 15% | Potential for reducing organizational risk | 1-10 |
| **Implementation Feasibility** | 10% | Ease of implementation and resource availability | 1-10 |
| **ROI Potential** | 10% | Expected return on investment | 1-10 |
| **Stakeholder Impact** | 3% | Impact on key stakeholders | 1-10 |
| **Innovation Enablement** | 2% | Potential to enable innovation and growth | 1-10 |

### 1.2 Scoring Methodology

**Weighted Priority Score Calculation:**
```
Priority Score = Î£(Criteria Score Ã— Weight)
Where:
- Business Impact Ã— 0.25
- Gap Severity Ã— 0.20
- Strategic Alignment Ã— 0.15
- Risk Mitigation Ã— 0.15
- Implementation Feasibility Ã— 0.10
- ROI Potential Ã— 0.10
- Stakeholder Impact Ã— 0.03
- Innovation Enablement Ã— 0.02
```

**Priority Classification:**
- **Critical (9.0-10.0):** Immediate action required (0-3 months)
- **High (7.0-8.9):** Short-term implementation (3-6 months)
- **Medium (5.0-6.9):** Medium-term enhancement (6-12 months)
- **Low (1.0-4.9):** Long-term optimization (12+ months)
