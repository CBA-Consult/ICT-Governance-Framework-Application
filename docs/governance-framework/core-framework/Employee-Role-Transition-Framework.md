## Introduction

### Purpose
This framework defines the structured approach for managing employee role transitions, ensuring that changes in job functions are executed with proper governance, security controls, and business continuity measures. It integrates with existing ICT governance processes and employee lifecycle management procedures.

### Scope
This framework applies to:
- All internal role changes and promotions
- Departmental transfers and reorganizations
- Management succession planning initiatives
- Temporary role assignments and acting positions
- Cross-functional project assignments
- Role consolidations and expansions

### Key Principles
- **Least Privileged Access:** Ensure employees have only the minimum access required for their new role
- **Segregation of Duties:** Maintain appropriate separation of responsibilities to prevent conflicts of interest
- **Business Continuity:** Minimize disruption to business operations during transitions
- **Security First:** Prioritize security controls throughout the transition process
- **Documented Handover:** Ensure comprehensive documentation and knowledge transfer
- **Compliance Adherence:** Maintain compliance with regulatory and policy requirements

## Role Transition Types
