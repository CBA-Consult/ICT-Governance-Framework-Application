## 1. Data Governance Overview

### 1.1 Framework Purpose and Scope

**Purpose:**
The Data Governance Framework establishes the organizational structure, policies, processes, and technologies required to ensure that data across the ICT Governance Platform is:
- **Accurate and Reliable**: High-quality data that supports decision-making
- **Secure and Protected**: Appropriate controls to protect sensitive information
- **Compliant**: Adherence to regulatory and organizational requirements
- **Accessible**: Available to authorized users when needed
- **Valuable**: Leveraged as a strategic organizational asset

**Scope:**
This framework applies to all data within the ICT Governance ecosystem, including:
- Governance and policy data
- Asset and configuration data
- Identity and access data
- Risk and compliance data
- Operational and performance data
- Analytical and reporting data
