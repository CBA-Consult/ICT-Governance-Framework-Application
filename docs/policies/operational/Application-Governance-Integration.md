# Application Governance Integration

This document outlines how the Employee App Store and SIEM/Cloud App Security components integrate with the ICT Governance Framework to provide comprehensive application governance and shadow IT detection.

## Purpose

The Application Governance Integration extends the ICT Governance Framework to include:

1. **Shadow IT Detection and Management**: Identifying unauthorized applications as a critical form of infrastructure drift
2. Comprehensive application lifecycle management
3. Automated discovery of shadow IT through security tools
4. Structured validation and approval workflows for applications
5. Complete visibility of all applications used on company devices
6. Governance-compliant application distribution

## Governance Structure Integration

The application governance components align with the three-tiered structure of the ICT Governance Framework:

### ICT Governance Council (IGC)
- Approves application governance policies
- Reviews critical shadow IT findings
- Approves exceptions for high-risk applications
- Reviews application compliance metrics quarterly

### Technology Domain Owners
- **Application Governance Owner**:
  - Responsible for application approval policies
  - Oversees the Employee App Store and validation workflows
  - Manages application compliance metrics
  - Coordinates with Security Owner on shadow IT detection
- **Security Owner**:
  - Responsible for security monitoring and controls
  - Oversees SIEM and Cloud App Security implementation
  - Reviews security findings and vulnerabilities
  - Defines shadow IT detection and remediation policies

### Technology Stewards
- **Security Steward**:
  - Manages security aspects, controls, and shadow IT detection
  - Operates SIEM and Cloud App Security monitoring
  - Coordinates validation of discovered applications
- **Applications Steward**:
  - Ensures application standards compliance and manages application catalog
  - Administers Employee App Store and application validation process
  - Reviews and categorizes discovered applications

## Key Components

### 1. Employee App Store
The Employee App Store provides a governance-compliant platform for application distribution and management:

- **Application Registry**: Database of approved applications and metadata
- **Validation Workflow**: Process for evaluating and approving applications
- **Distribution System**: Mechanism for deploying approved applications
- **Compliance Reporting**: Metrics and dashboards for application governance

### 2. SIEM and Cloud App Security Integration
The security integration components provide automated discovery and assessment of applications:

- **Application Discovery**: Detection of applications through security monitoring
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of application security posture
- **Validation Routing**: Workflow for employee justification and approval
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Tracking of unauthorized application usage

## Shadow IT as Infrastructure Drift

Shadow IT detection is a critical component of the comprehensive infrastructure drift detection strategy:

### 1. Definition and Scope
Shadow IT represents a significant form of infrastructure drift that:
- Bypasses established governance processes
- Introduces security and compliance risks
- Creates undocumented dependencies
- Fragments the organization's technology landscape

### 2. Detection Mechanisms
Shadow IT drift is detected through multiple integrated mechanisms:

- **SIEM Integration**: Security Information and Event Management tools monitor network traffic and endpoint activity
- **Cloud App Security**: Monitors cloud service usage, API calls, and data movement
- **Device Monitoring**: Endpoint detection solutions identify installed applications
- **Network Monitoring**: Traffic analysis identifies communication with unauthorized services
- **User Activity Monitoring**: Identifies usage patterns indicative of shadow IT

### 3. Integration with Infrastructure Drift Management
Shadow IT detection is fully integrated with broader infrastructure drift management:

- **Unified Drift Dashboard**: Combines infrastructure and application drift in a single view
- **Integrated Alerts**: Shadow IT alerts are prioritized alongside other infrastructure drift alerts
- **Common Investigation Workflow**: Uses the same tools and processes as other drift investigations
- **Joint Remediation Planning**: Application and infrastructure teams collaborate on drift remediation

### 4. Drift Investigation Process
The investigation process for shadow IT drift follows a structured approach:

1. **Initial Detection**: SIEM/CAS identifies potential shadow IT
2. **Triage and Classification**: Security Steward classifies by risk level and potential impact
3. **Investigation**: Determine usage patterns, business purpose, and security implications
4. **Validation Determination**: Route for employee validation or immediate remediation
5. **Remediation Planning**: Develop plan to address the drift, either through approval or removal
6. **Implementation**: Execute remediation plan
7. **Verification**: Confirm drift has been resolved
8. **Lessons Learned**: Update detection mechanisms and governance processes

This approach ensures that Shadow IT is treated as a critical form of infrastructure drift that requires the same level of attention and rigor as other forms of governance deviation.

## Integration with Existing Governance Processes

### 1. Change Management Integration
Application changes follow the established change management process:

1. **Request**: Application request or discovery triggers workflow
2. **Review**: Application Steward reviews request or discovery
3. **Approval**: Based on risk, follows appropriate approval path
4. **Implementation**: Deployment through Employee App Store
5. **Verification**: Compliance verification through monitoring

### 2. Employee Lifecycle Integration
Application governance is integrated with employee lifecycle management:

#### 2.1 Employee Onboarding
- **Application Provisioning**: Automated provisioning of approved applications based on role
- **Access Rights Assignment**: Role-based access control implementation
- **Training and Orientation**: Application usage training and governance awareness
- **Documentation Access**: Provision of SOPs and application documentation

#### 2.2 Employee Role Changes
- **Access Rights Review**: Evaluation of application access requirements for new role
- **Application Transfer**: Transfer of application ownership and responsibilities
- **Training Updates**: Additional training for new application responsibilities
- **Documentation Updates**: Update of SOPs and application documentation

#### 2.3 Employee Offboarding
- **Application Discovery**: Comprehensive discovery of all applications used by departing employee
- **Application Registry Creation**: Documentation of individually registered applications
- **Account Transfer**: Transfer of application accounts to designated successors
- **Data Migration**: Secure transfer of company data from individual applications
- **Vendor Coordination**: Communication with vendors for account ownership changes
- **Compliance Verification**: Confirmation that transferred applications meet compliance requirements
- **Access Termination**: Revocation of departing employee's access to all applications
- **Post-Departure Monitoring**: Verification of successful handover and continued access for successors

### 3. Compliance Monitoring Integration
Application compliance is integrated into existing compliance reporting:

- **Application Compliance Dashboard**: Shows application governance metrics including offboarding status
- **Shadow IT Report**: Details unauthorized applications and remediation status
- **Application Risk Report**: Evaluates application security posture
- **Offboarding Compliance Report**: Tracks completion of application handover procedures
- **Individual Registration Report**: Monitors applications with individual registrations requiring migration

### 4. Audit Integration
Application governance activities are included in audit scope:

- **Validation Audit**: Review of application approval decisions
- **Discovery Audit**: Verification of shadow IT detection processes
- **Compliance Audit**: Assessment of application governance effectiveness
- **Offboarding Audit**: Review of employee application offboarding procedures
- **Individual Registration Audit**: Assessment of individual application registration compliance
