## 1. Information Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architecture Principles

**Core Principles:**
- **Information as a Strategic Asset**: Treat information as a critical organizational resource
- **Single Source of Truth**: Eliminate information silos and duplication
- **Context-Aware Access**: Provide relevant information based on user context and role
- **Self-Service Capabilities**: Enable stakeholders to access information independently
- **Real-Time Intelligence**: Provide timely information for decision-making
- **Privacy and Security by Design**: Embed protection controls throughout the architecture
