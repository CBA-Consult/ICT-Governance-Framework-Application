## 2. Action Plan Development Process

### 2.1 Phase 1: Strategic Assessment (Days 1-5)

#### **Step 1: Business Needs Assessment**

**Objective:** Understand the business context and requirements driving the IT initiative.

**Activities:**
1. **Stakeholder Identification and Engagement**
   - Map all stakeholders (primary, secondary, key influencers)
   - Conduct stakeholder interviews and workshops
   - Document stakeholder needs, expectations, and constraints

2. **Business Objective Analysis**
   - Review organizational strategic plan and priorities
   - Identify specific business challenges or opportunities
   - Map IT initiative to business value drivers

3. **Current State Assessment**
   - Document existing capabilities and limitations
   - Identify gaps between current and desired state
   - Assess organizational readiness for change

**Deliverables:**
- Stakeholder Analysis Report
- Business Requirements Document
- Current State Assessment
- Gap Analysis Summary

#### **Step 2: SWOT Analysis**

**Objective:** Systematically assess internal and external factors affecting the initiative.

**SWOT Analysis Template:**

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
|---------------|----------------|
| • Internal capabilities that support success<br>• Existing technology assets and expertise<br>• Organizational culture and change readiness<br>• Available resources and budget<br>• Leadership support and sponsorship | • Skill gaps or resource constraints<br>• Legacy system limitations<br>• Organizational resistance to change<br>• Budget or timeline constraints<br>• Competing priorities |

| **Opportunities** | **Threats** |
|-------------------|-------------|
| • Market trends that can be leveraged<br>• Technology innovations and capabilities<br>• Regulatory changes creating advantages<br>• Partnership and collaboration possibilities<br>• Process improvement potential | • Competitive pressures<br>• Regulatory compliance requirements<br>• Technology obsolescence risks<br>• Security and privacy concerns<br>• Economic or market uncertainties |

**Analysis Process:**
1. Conduct facilitated SWOT workshop with key stakeholders
2. Prioritize factors based on impact and likelihood
3. Develop strategies to leverage strengths and opportunities
4. Create mitigation plans for weaknesses and threats

### 2.2 Phase 2: Initiative Design (Days 6-15)

#### **Step 3: SMART Goal Definition**

**Objective:** Establish clear, measurable objectives for the IT initiative.

**SMART Goal Template:**

| **Component** | **Description** | **Example** |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Specific** | What exactly will be accomplished? | Implement a new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system |
| **Measurable** | How will success be quantified? | Increase customer satisfaction scores by 20% and reduce response time by 50% |
| **Achievable** | Is this realistic given resources? | Based on vendor capabilities and allocated budget of $500K |
| **Relevant** | How does this support business objectives? | Directly supports strategic goal of improving customer experience |
| **Time-bound** | When will this be completed? | Full implementation within 12 months, with pilot in 6 months |

**Goal Development Process:**
1. Draft initial goals based on business requirements
2. Validate goals with stakeholders for clarity and alignment
3. Refine goals to ensure SMART criteria are met
4. Document goal dependencies and assumptions

#### **Step 4: MoSCoW Prioritization**

**Objective:** Prioritize initiative components to optimize value delivery and resource allocation.

**MoSCoW Prioritization Matrix:**

| **Priority** | **Criteria** | **Resource Allocation** | **Timeline** |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| **Must Have** | • Critical for minimum viable solution<br>• Regulatory or compliance requirements<br>• Core business functionality | 60-70% of resources | Phase 1 delivery |
| **Should Have** | • Important for optimal solution<br>• Significant business value<br>• User experience enhancements | 20-25% of resources | Phase 2 delivery |
| **Could Have** | • Nice to have features<br>• Process improvements<br>• Additional integrations | 10-15% of resources | Phase 3 delivery |
| **Won't Have** | • Out of scope for current initiative<br>• Future enhancement opportunities<br>• Low value or high risk items | 0% of current resources | Future roadmap |

**Prioritization Process:**
1. List all identified requirements and features
2. Facilitate stakeholder workshop to assign MoSCoW categories
3. Validate prioritization against business value and technical dependencies
4. Document rationale for prioritization decisions

### 2.3 Phase 3: Detailed Planning (Days 16-25)

#### **Step 5: Work Breakdown Structure Development**

**Objective:** Decompose the initiative into manageable work packages with clear deliverables.

**WBS Template Structure:**

```
1.0 [Initiative Name]
├── 1.1 Project Initiation
│   ├── 1.1.1 Project Charter Development
│   ├── 1.1.2 Stakeholder Engagement Plan
│   └── 1.1.3 Project Team Formation

#### **Step 6: Resource Allocation Planning**

**Objective:** Systematically plan and allocate resources across all initiative components.

**Resource Allocation Matrix:**

| **Work Package** | **Human Resources** | **Financial Resources** | **Technology Resources** | **Timeline** | **Dependencies** |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| [Work Package Name] | • Role 1: X hours<br>• Role 2: Y hours<br>• External: Z hours | • Labor: $X<br>• Technology: $Y<br>• Other: $Z | • Hardware requirements<br>• Software licenses<br>• Infrastructure needs | Start: [Date]<br>End: [Date]<br>Duration: [Days] | • Prerequisite tasks<br>• External dependencies<br>• Resource constraints |

**Resource Planning Process:**
