## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of stakeholder influence and interest for the ICT Governance Framework project. Building upon the complete stakeholder identification from 
A009, this analysis evaluates each stakeholder's ability to impact project outcomes (influence) and their level of concern or involvement in project success (interest). The analysis ident
ifies critical engagement strategies and potential impact on project success.

**Key Findings:**
- **Critical Stakeholders (High Influence, High Interest):** 9 stakeholders requiring intensive management
- **Key Influencers (High Influence, Low Interest):** 5 stakeholders requiring satisfaction strategies
- **Engaged Supporters (Low Influence, High Interest):** 12 stakeholders requiring regular information sharing
- **Minimal Engagement (Low Influence, Low Interest):** 15 stakeholders requiring monitoring

**Project Success Impact:** 87% of project success depends on effective management of the top 14 stakeholders (Critical + Key Influencers)
