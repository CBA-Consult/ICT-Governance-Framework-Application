## Technical Architecture Alignment

### Integration with Existing Framework

The requirements have been designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing ICT Governance Framework:

**Existing Components Leveraged:**
- `/app/components/dashboards/ExecutiveDashboard.js` - Foundation for CISO dashboard
- `/app/compliance-dashboard/page.js` - Compliance monitoring capabilities
- `/api/monitoring.js` - Real-time monitoring infrastructure
- `/api/alerts.js` - Security alerting and incident management
- `/api/data-processing.js` - Data aggregation and analytics

**New Components Required:**
- Security scoring and metrics aggregation (addressing secure-scores.js requirement)
- Threat landscape visualization
- Risk management dashboard
- Executive reporting automation
- Mobile-responsive interface enhancements

### Security Scoring Integration

**Note on secure-scores.js:** While the specific file `ict-governance-framework\api\secure-scores.js` mentioned in the requirements was not found in the current codebase, the requirements include comprehensive security scoring capabilities:

- **FR-SEC-001:** Real-Time Security Dashboard with overall security score
- **FR-SEC-005:** Security Controls Effectiveness monitoring
- **FR-COMP-001:** Compliance scoring across regulatory frameworks
- **FR-RISK-001:** Risk scoring and quantitative analysis

**Recommended Implementation:**
```javascript
// Proposed: /api/security-scores.js
// Aggregate security scores from multiple sources:
// - Microsoft Defender for Cloud secure score
// - Compliance framework scores
// - Risk assessment scores
// - Vulnerability management scores
```
