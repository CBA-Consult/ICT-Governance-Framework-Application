## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Structured Approach:** Following standardized requirement structure ensured consistency
2. **Stakeholder Input:** Building on comprehensive A029 outputs provided solid foundation
3. **Balanced Coverage:** Addressing both functional and non-functional aspects comprehensively
4. **Traceability:** Maintaining clear links to source requirements enabled validation

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Stakeholder Review:** Earlier stakeholder review cycles could improve requirement quality
2. **Prototyping:** Some requirements could benefit from prototype validation
3. **Prioritization:** More detailed prioritization criteria could enhance decision-making

### Recommendations for Future Activities
1. Conduct stakeholder review sessions for requirement validation
2. Develop prototypes for complex user interface requirements
3. Establish regular requirement review and update cycles
4. Implement automated traceability tracking
