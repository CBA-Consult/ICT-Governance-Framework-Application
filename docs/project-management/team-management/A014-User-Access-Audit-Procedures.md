## Audit Overview

### Purpose

The user access audit ensures that:
- Users have appropriate access levels based on their roles
- Access permissions align with business requirements
- Inactive or terminated users are properly removed
- Compliance with security policies is maintained
- Segregation of duties is enforced

### Audit Principles

1. **Least Privilege** - Users have minimum access required for their role
2. **Need-to-Know** - Access is granted based on business necessity
3. **Regular Review** - Access is reviewed at defined intervals
4. **Documentation** - All access decisions are documented
5. **Accountability** - Access changes are traceable to authorized personnel

## Audit Scope and Frequency

| Platform | Audit Frequency | Risk Level | Special Considerations |
|----------|----------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Microsoft Teams** | Quarterly | Medium | Channel-level permissions |

```powershell
# Define audit scope parameters
$AuditScope = @{
    Platforms = @("Teams", "SharePoint", "DevOps", "Project", "PowerPlatform")
    TimeFrame = "2025-Q3"
    UserGroups = @("All-Users", "Privileged-Users", "External-Users")
    FocusAreas = @("Access-Rights", "Permissions", "Group-Membership")
    ComplianceFrameworks = @("ISO27001", "SOX", "GDPR")
}
```

#### Resource Allocation
- Assign audit team members
- Schedule audit activities
- Reserve system resources
- Coordinate with platform owners

#### Stakeholder Notification
```powershell
# Notify stakeholders of upcoming audit
$NotificationList = @(
    "governance-council@company.com",
    "platform-owners@company.com",
    "security-team@company.com",
    "compliance-team@company.com"
)

$AuditNotification = @{
    Subject = "Upcoming User Access Audit - Q3 2025"
    Body = @"

    ExternalUsers = Get-AzureADUser -Filter "userType eq 'Guest'"
    ServiceAccounts = Get-AzureADUser -Filter "userType eq 'ServiceAccount'"
}
```

#### Group Membership
```powershell
# Collect group membership data
$GroupMembership = @{
    SecurityGroups = Get-AzureADGroup -Filter "securityEnabled eq true"
    DistributionGroups = Get-AzureADGroup -Filter "mailEnabled eq true"
    Teams = Get-Team
    SharePointGroups = Get-PnPGroup

### 2. Manual Verification

#### Access Rights Validation
```powershell
# Manual access validation checklist
$ValidationChecklist = @{
    UserAccess = @{
        "Verify user still employed" = $false
        "Confirm role alignment" = $false
        "Check business justification" = $false
        "Validate approval documentation" = $false
    }
    GroupMembership = @{
        "Review group purpose" = $false
        "Confirm membership necessity" = $false
        "Check nested group memberships" = $false
        "Validate group owners" = $false
    }
    Permissions = @{
        "Review permission levels" = $false
        "Check for excessive privileges" = $false
        "Validate inheritance settings" = $false
        "Confirm exception approvals" = $false
    }
}
```

#### Exception Review
- Document all access exceptions
- Verify business justifications
- Confirm approval authorities
- Check expiration dates

## Platform-Specific Audit Steps

### Microsoft Teams Audit

#### 1. Team Membership Review
```powershell
# Teams membership audit
function Audit-TeamsAccess {
    param([string]$TeamName)
    
    $Team = Get-Team -DisplayName $TeamName
    $Members = Get-TeamUser -GroupId $Team.GroupId
    
    $AuditResults = @{
        TeamInfo = $Team
        MemberAnalysis = @{
            TotalMembers = $Members.Count
            Owners = ($Members | Where-Object {$_.Role -eq "Owner"}).Count
            Members = ($Members | Where-Object {$_.Role -eq "Member"}).Count
            Guests = ($Members | Where-Object {$_.Role -eq "Guest"}).Count
        }
        Findings = @()
    }
    
    # Check for excessive owners
    if ($AuditResults.MemberAnalysis.Owners -gt 3) {
        $AuditResults.Findings += "Excessive number of team owners"
    }
    
    # Check for external guests
    if ($AuditResults.MemberAnalysis.Guests -gt 0) {
        $AuditResults.Findings += "External guests present - verify business need"
    }
    
    return $AuditResults
}
```

#### 2. Channel Permissions
- Review private channel access
- Validate guest access to channels
- Check channel-specific permissions
- Verify moderation settings

### SharePoint Online Audit

#### 1. Site Collection Permissions
```powershell
# SharePoint permissions audit
function Audit-SharePointPermissions {
    param([string]$SiteUrl)
    
    Connect-PnPOnline -Url $SiteUrl -UseWebLogin
    
    $PermissionAudit = @{
        SiteInfo = Get-PnPWeb
        Groups = @()
        UniquePermissions = @()
        ExternalSharing = @()
    }
    
    # Audit site groups
    $SiteGroups = Get-PnPGroup
    foreach ($group in $SiteGroups) {
        $GroupAudit = @{
            GroupName = $group.Title
            Members = Get-PnPGroupMember -Identity $group.Title
            Permissions = Get-PnPGroupPermissions -Identity $group.Title
        }
        $PermissionAudit.Groups += $GroupAudit
    }
    
    # Check for unique permissions
    $Lists = Get-PnPList
    foreach ($list in $Lists) {
        if ($list.HasUniqueRoleAssignments) {
            $UniquePermission = @{
                ListTitle = $list.Title
                Permissions = Get-PnPListPermission -Identity $list.Title
            }
            $PermissionAudit.UniquePermissions += $UniquePermission
        }
    }
    
    return $PermissionAudit
}
```

#### 2. External Sharing Review
- Identify externally shared content
- Verify sharing permissions
- Check anonymous link usage
- Review expiration settings

### Azure DevOps Audit

#### 1. Project Access Review
```bash
# DevOps project access audit
function Audit-DevOpsProject {
    param([string]$ProjectName)
    
    # Get project details
    $Project = az devops project show --project $ProjectName --output json | ConvertFrom-Json
    
    # Get project permissions
    $Permissions = az devops security permission list --id $Project.id --output json | ConvertFrom-Json
    
    # Get repository permissions
    $Repos = az repos list --project $ProjectName --output json | ConvertFrom-Json
    
    $AuditResults = @{
        ProjectInfo = $Project
        Permissions = $Permissions
        Repositories = @()
    }
    
    foreach ($repo in $Repos) {
        $RepoPermissions = az repos policy list --repository-id $repo.id --project $ProjectName --output json | ConvertFrom-Json
        $AuditResults.Repositories += @{
            RepoName = $repo.name
            Permissions = $RepoPermissions
        }
    }
    
    return $AuditResults
}
```

#### 2. Pipeline Security

The Finance Reports document library has been granted Full Control permissions 
to the All Company Users group, providing unnecessary access to sensitive 
financial information.
"@
    Evidence = @(
        "SharePoint-Permissions-Screenshot.png",
        "Permission-Report-20250808.csv"
