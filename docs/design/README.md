- **Desktop**: 1024px - 1439px (Multi-column, mouse-optimized)
- **Large Desktop**: 1440px+ (Enhanced layout, maximum efficiency)

### Mobile Optimizations
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe navigation between tabs
- **Collapsible Sections**: Progressive disclosure for content
- **Optimized Forms**: Single-column layout with proper input types

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load content as needed
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with WebP format
- **Code Splitting**: Load components on demand
- **Caching Strategy**: Optimize for repeat visits

## 🎨 Visual Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: #2563eb (Professional blue for actions and links)
- **Secondary**: #6b7280 (Neutral gray for secondary content)
- **Success**: #10b981 (Green for confirmations and success states)
- **Warning**: #f59e0b (Orange for warnings and attention)
- **Error**: #ef4444 (Red for errors and destructive actions)

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Inter (Primary), System fonts (Fallback)
- **Scale**: Modular scale from 12px to 36px
- **Weights**: Normal (400), Medium (500), Semibold (600), Bold (700)
