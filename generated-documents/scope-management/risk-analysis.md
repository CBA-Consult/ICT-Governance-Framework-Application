Owner: Risk Management

## Purpose
Assess program risks, likelihood/impact, mitigations, and contingency plans.

## Categories
- Strategic, Operational, Security/Privacy, Financial, Compliance, Technology, Third-Party.

## Method
- Qualitative matrix (1–5) for likelihood/impact; inherent vs residual risk; treatment plans.

## Example Risks
- Policy automation fails audit requirements → strengthen evidence controls, pilot and iterate.
- Integration outages impact operations → circuit breakers, retries, sandbox testing.
- Cost overruns due to scale → budgets, autoscaling, cost dashboards, optimization.

## Monitoring
- Risk reviews monthly; KRIs tracked; link to Risk Register when available.
