## Principles
- Clarity, consistency, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and responsiveness.

## Key Journeys
- Author policy/control; attach evidence; review posture; file exceptions; approve changes.

## Patterns
- Search and filter lists; inline edits; progressive disclosure; helpful empty states.

## Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast; localization-ready.

## Validation
- Usability testing; error messages from Error Handling Guidelines; keep users in context.
