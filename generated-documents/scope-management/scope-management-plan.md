## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Scope Management Plan defines how the scope for the ICT Governance Framework project will be defined, validated, and controlled. It establishes clear procedures for documenting project scope, managing changes, and ensuring all required work is completed successfully while preventing scope creep. This plan serves as a guide for the project team to effectively manage scope throughout the project lifecycle.

### 1.2 Project Description

The ICT Governance Framework project aims to establish a comprehensive and unified governance structure for information and communication technology resources across the organization. The framework will enhance alignment between IT initiatives and business objectives, strengthen security posture, improve regulatory compliance, and optimize IT resource utilization.

### 1.3 Scope Management Approach

Scope management for this project will follow the PMBOK framework and include:

- Detailed scope planning and documentation
- Requirements collection and categorization
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) creation
- Formal scope verification and acceptance
- Structured change management process
- Regular scope reviews and variance analysis

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Scope Management Responsibilities |
|------|----------------------------------|
| Project Sponsor | - Final approval of project scope<br>- Approval of major scope changes<br>- Resolution of scope issues escalated by Steering Committee |
| Steering Committee | - Review and approve scope baseline<br>- Evaluate and approve scope change requests that exceed thresholds<br>- Monitor scope management effectiveness |
| Project Manager | - Develop and maintain the Scope Management Plan<br>- Facilitate scope definition activities<br>- Create and maintain the WBS<br>- Assess change requests<br>- Track and report on scope status<br>- Facilitate scope verification |
| Technical Lead | - Provide technical input for scope definition<br>- Review scope feasibility<br>- Assess technical impact of change requests<br>- Support scope verification activities |
| Business Analysts | - Document detailed requirements<br>- Trace requirements to scope elements<br>- Support scope change impact analysis |
| Subject Matter Experts | - Provide domain expertise for scope definition<br>- Support requirements definition<br>- Verify scope deliverables in their domain areas |
| Change Control Board | - Review and approve/reject scope change requests<br>- Assess impact of proposed changes<br>- Ensure proper documentation of approved changes |
| Project Team Members | - Contribute to scope definition in their areas<br>- Implement project work according to defined scope<br>- Identify potential scope issues |

## 3. Scope Definition Process

### 3.1 Requirements Collection

Requirements will be collected from stakeholders through:

1. Stakeholder workshops and interviews
2. Review of existing documentation
3. Analysis of current state governance practices
4. Regulatory and compliance analysis
5. Best practice research
6. Vendor and tool assessments

Requirements will be categorized as:
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Technical requirements
- Governance requirements
- Compliance requirements
- Transition requirements

### 3.2 Requirements Analysis

Requirements will be analyzed for:
- Clarity and completeness
- Feasibility and practicality
- Alignment with project objectives
- Prioritization (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have)
- Dependencies and constraints
- Measurability and testability

### 3.3 Scope Statement Development

The Project Scope Statement will be developed collaboratively with key stakeholders and will include:

1. Project justification
2. Project objectives
3. Deliverables
4. Acceptance criteria
5. Exclusions (what is out of scope)
6. Constraints
7. Assumptions

### 3.4 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Creation

The WBS will:
- Decompose the total project scope into manageable components
- Be developed to at least level 3 for planning purposes
- Include a WBS Dictionary with detailed descriptions
- Be aligned with the project phases and deliverables
- Serve as the foundation for schedule and cost planning

### 3.5 Scope Baseline Approval

The scope baseline will consist of:
- Approved Project Scope Statement
- WBS
- WBS Dictionary

The scope baseline will be formally reviewed and approved by the Project Sponsor and Steering Committee before proceeding to project execution.

## 4. Scope Control

### 4.1 Measuring Scope Performance

Scope performance will be measured through:
- Deliverable completion status
- Requirements traceability matrix updates
- Scope variance analysis
- Earned Value Management metrics (if applicable)
- Quality review results

### 4.2 Scope Change Control Process

| Step | Description | Responsibility |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Submit Change Request | Requestor |
| 2 | Log and Assess Change Request | Project Manager |
| 3 | Analyze Impact | Project Manager, Technical Lead, Business Analyst |
| 4 | Review and Decide | Change Control Board |
| 5 | Update Project Documentation | Project Manager |
| 6 | Communicate Decision | Project Manager |
| 7 | Implement Approved Changes | Project Team |
| 8 | Verify Implementation | Project Manager, Quality Assurance |

All scope changes must be submitted using the standard Change Request Form and will be evaluated for impacts on:
- Project schedule
- Project budget
- Resources
- Quality
- Risk
- Other project constraints

### 4.3 Change Request Approval Thresholds

| Impact Level | Approval Authority |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Minor changes (no impact on schedule/budget) | Project Manager |
| Medium changes (1-5% impact on schedule/budget) | Project Manager and Technical Lead |
| Significant changes (5-10% impact on schedule/budget) | Change Control Board |
| Major changes (>10% impact on schedule/budget) | Steering Committee |

### 4.4 Scope Change Documentation

All approved scope changes will be documented in:
- Change request log
- Updated scope statement
- Updated WBS (if applicable)
- Updated requirements documentation
- Updated project schedule
- Updated project budget
- Project status reports

## 5. Scope Verification and Acceptance

### 5.1 Verification Process

Deliverables will be verified through:
- Quality reviews against acceptance criteria
- Requirements traceability verification
- Stakeholder reviews
- Testing (where applicable)
- Demonstration of functionality
- Documentation review

### 5.2 Acceptance Criteria

General acceptance criteria include:
- Compliance with requirements
- Completeness of deliverables
- Quality standards met
- Documentation completed
- Stakeholder approval obtained

Specific acceptance criteria for major deliverables are detailed in the Project Scope Statement.

### 5.3 Formal Acceptance

Formal acceptance will be documented using the Deliverable Acceptance Form, which must be signed by:
- The deliverable owner
- The receiving stakeholder(s)
- The Project Manager
- The Project Sponsor (for major deliverables)

## 6. Scope Management Tools and Templates

The following tools and templates will be used:
- Requirements Management System
- Change Request Form
- Requirements Traceability Matrix
- Deliverable Acceptance Form
- WBS Development Tool
- Scope Change Log
- Scope Status Report Template

## 7. Integration with Other Project Management Processes

### 7.1 Schedule Management

- WBS elements will be used as the basis for activity definition
- Scope changes will trigger schedule impact analysis and updates

### 7.2 Cost Management

- WBS elements will be used for cost estimation and budgeting
- Scope changes will trigger cost impact analysis and updates

### 7.3 Quality Management

- Requirements will inform quality metrics and acceptance criteria
- Scope verification will include quality verification

### 7.4 Risk Management

- Scope definition will inform risk identification
- Scope changes will trigger risk reassessment

### 7.5 Communication Management

- Scope baseline and changes will be communicated to stakeholders
- Scope status will be included in regular project reporting

## 8. Continuous Improvement

This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed:
- At the end of each project phase
- When significant scope issues arise
- When process improvements are identified

Lessons learned related to scope management will be documented and used to improve future projects.
