## Purpose
Define comprehensive quantitative risk assessment approach using FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) methodology for all ICT domains, enabling data-driven risk management decisions and business-aligned risk tolerance.

## Scope
All technology assets, services, and initiatives across the six ICT domains:
- üñ•Ô∏è Infrastructure (Networks, servers, cloud resources, endpoint devices)
- üîê Security (Identity management, access controls, threat protection, Zero Trust)
- üíª Applications (Enterprise applications, custom software, SaaS solutions)
- üìä Data (Structured and unstructured data, analytics platforms)
- üì± End-user Computing (Productivity tools, collaboration platforms, mobile devices)
- üîÑ Integration (APIs, middleware, data exchange mechanisms)

## Methods
### Primary Method: FAIR-Based Quantitative Risk Assessment
- **Risk Equation:** Risk = Loss Event Frequency (LEF) √ó Loss Magnitude (LM)
- **LEF Calculation:** Threat Event Frequency (TEF) √ó Vulnerability (V)
- **LM Calculation:** Primary Loss (PL) + Secondary Loss (SL)
- **Domain-Specific Implementation:** Tailored FAIR application for each ICT domain

### Supplementary Methods
- **Qualitative Assessment:** Likelihood/Impact scaling for initial screening
- **Scenario Analysis:** Multiple risk scenario evaluation and comparison
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Testing assumptions and uncertainty ranges
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** For complex risk interactions and portfolio analysis

## FAIR Assessment Process

### Phase 1: Risk Identification and Scoping (Days 1-3)
1. **Domain Scope Definition:** Identify specific ICT domain areas for assessment
2. **Asset and Process Inventory:** Catalog relevant assets, processes, and dependencies
3. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Involve domain owners and subject matter experts
4. **Risk Scenario Development:** Define specific risk scenarios for assessment

### Phase 2: Threat and Vulnerability Analysis (Days 4-10)
1. **Threat Intelligence Gathering:** Collect relevant threat data and industry intelligence
2. **Vulnerability Assessment:** Evaluate technical and operational vulnerabilities
3. **Control Effectiveness Analysis:** Assess current control performance
4. **Historical Data Analysis:** Review past incidents and near-misses

### Phase 3: FAIR Quantification (Days 11-15)
1. **Loss Event Frequency Calculation:** Quantify TEF and Vulnerability factors
2. **Loss Magnitude Assessment:** Calculate Primary and Secondary Loss impacts
3. **Risk Calculation:** Apply FAIR methodology to determine risk exposure
4. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Test assumptions and assess uncertainty ranges

### Phase 4: Risk Evaluation and Reporting (Days 16-21)
1. **Risk Tolerance Comparison:** Compare calculated risk to organizational risk appetite
2. **Risk Prioritization:** Rank risks by exposure and business impact
3. **Mitigation Analysis:** Evaluate risk treatment options and cost-effectiveness
4. **Executive Reporting:** Present findings and recommendations to governance council

## Metrics

### FAIR-Specific Metrics
- **Total Risk Exposure:** Aggregate quantified risk across all ICT domains (<$2M annually)
- **Risk Assessment Coverage:** Percentage of assets with completed FAIR assessments (>95%)
- **Risk Assessment Timeliness:** Average time to complete risk assessments (<21 days)
- **Risk Prediction Accuracy:** Accuracy rate for FAIR risk predictions vs. actual incidents (>85%)
- **Domain Risk Distribution:** Risk exposure breakdown across six ICT domains

### Process Metrics
- **Assessment Completion Rate:** Percentage of scheduled assessments completed on time (>95%)
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Participation rate of domain experts in assessments (>90%)
- **Risk Model Calibration:** Frequency of model updates based on new data (Quarterly)
- **Risk Treatment Effectiveness:** Reduction in risk exposure from implemented controls (>80%)
