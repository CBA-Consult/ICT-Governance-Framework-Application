## Purpose
Define the comprehensive FAIR-based quantitative risk management approach for all ICT domains, establishing risk governance practices that enable data-driven decision making and business-aligned risk tolerance.

## Scope
All technology assets, services, and initiatives across the organization's six ICT domains:
- üñ•Ô∏è Infrastructure: Networks, servers, cloud resources, endpoint devices
- üîê Security: Identity management, access controls, threat protection, Zero Trust architecture
- üíª Applications: Enterprise applications, custom software, SaaS solutions, employee-requested applications
- üìä Data: Structured and unstructured data, analytics platforms
- üì± End-user Computing: Productivity tools, collaboration platforms, mobile devices
- üîÑ Integration: APIs, middleware, data exchange mechanisms, security information exchange

## FAIR-Based Process Overview

### 1. Risk Identification and Scoping
- **Domain-Specific Risk Scenarios:** Identify risks specific to each ICT domain
- **Asset and Process Inventory:** Catalog technology assets and business processes
- **Threat Landscape Analysis:** Assess current and emerging threats
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Involve domain experts and business stakeholders

### 2. Quantitative Risk Analysis (FAIR Methodology)
- **Threat Event Frequency (TEF) Assessment:** Quantify likelihood of threat events
- **Vulnerability Analysis:** Assess probability of successful threat exploitation
- **Loss Event Frequency (LEF) Calculation:** TEF √ó Vulnerability
- **Primary Loss (PL) Assessment:** Direct financial and operational impacts
- **Secondary Loss (SL) Assessment:** Consequential impacts (reputation, legal, competitive)
- **Loss Magnitude (LM) Calculation:** PL + SL
- **Risk Calculation:** LEF √ó LM = Quantified Risk Exposure

### 3. Risk Evaluation and Treatment Planning
- **Risk Tolerance Comparison:** Compare calculated risk to organizational appetite
- **Risk Prioritization:** Rank risks by exposure and business impact
- **Treatment Option Analysis:** Evaluate mitigation strategies and cost-effectiveness
- **Risk-Adjusted Value Assessment:** Integrate with business value quantification

### 4. Risk Monitoring and Control
- **Continuous Risk Monitoring:** Track risk indicators and exposure trends
- **Control Effectiveness Assessment:** Measure performance of implemented controls
- **Risk Model Calibration:** Update models based on new data and incidents
- **Quarterly Risk Reviews:** Regular assessment of risk posture and treatment effectiveness

## Metrics

### Enterprise Risk Metrics
- **Total Risk Exposure:** Aggregate quantified risk across all ICT domains (<$2M annually)
- **Risk Trend Analysis:** Month-over-month and year-over-year risk exposure trends
- **Risk Concentration:** Distribution of risk across domains and business units
- **Risk Treatment Effectiveness:** Reduction in risk exposure from implemented controls (>80%)

### Domain-Specific Risk Metrics
- **Infrastructure Risk Exposure:** Quantified risk from infrastructure components
- **Security Risk Exposure:** Quantified cybersecurity and information security risk
- **Application Risk Exposure:** Quantified risk from application portfolio
- **Data Risk Exposure:** Quantified risk to data assets and privacy
- **End-user Computing Risk:** Quantified risk from endpoint and user activities
- **Integration Risk Exposure:** Quantified risk from system integrations

### Process Performance Metrics
- **Risk Assessment Coverage:** Percentage of assets with completed FAIR assessments (>95%)
- **Risk Assessment Timeliness:** Average time to complete risk assessments (<21 days)
- **Risk Treatment Implementation:** Percentage of approved treatments implemented on time (>90%)
- **Risk Monitoring Effectiveness:** Percentage of risks with current monitoring data (>98%)
