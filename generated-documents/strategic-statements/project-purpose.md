## Purpose
Deliver a unified ICT governance platform that automates policy enforcement, reduces risk, and accelerates delivery—anchored in COBIT, ITIL, ISO/IEC 38500, and Zero-Trust principles.

- Integrated governance of IaC, identity, cost, and operations

## Value

## Scope (Out)
Non-governance line-of-business features, legacy on-prem bespoke tooling.

## Success Criteria
