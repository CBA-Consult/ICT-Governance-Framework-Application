# System Design Specification (SDS)

Version: 1.0  
Date: 2025-08-08  
Owner: Architecture Board

## 1. Overview
- Scope: Services/components derived from the target architecture
- Constraints: Azure-first, zero-trust, API-first, event-driven

## 2. Logical Architecture
- Services: Governance engine, policy service, risk engine, analytics svc, integrations (ARM/ARG/Policy, ITSM, Cost, BI)
- Cross-cutting: Identity/RBAC, secrets, logging, telemetry, feature flags

## 3. Data Design
- Canonical entities: Policy, Control, Evidence, Resource, Finding, Exception, Ticket
- Storage: Azure SQL (relational), Cosmos DB (documents), Data Lake/Synapse (analytics), Key Vault (secrets)

## 4. Integration Design (high-level)
- Adapters: ARM/ARG/Policy, ServiceNow/JSM, Cost Mgmt, Power BI
- Patterns: Idempotent commands, retries with backoff, DLQs, correlation IDs

## 5. API Contracts
- REST; OpenAPI-first; consistent error model (problem+json)
- Versioning: Semantic; deprecation policy

## 6. Security
- SSO/MFA via Entra ID; RBAC + ABAC
- DLP hooks; encryption KMS; workload identities; managed identities

## 7. Availability & Performance
- SLOs: 99.9% svc; P95 <500ms; burst scaling; HPA configured

## 8. Observability
- Traces/metrics/logs; distributed tracing; tamper-evident audit logs

## 9. Deployment & Operability
- CI/CD: policy gates, signed artifacts, evidence bundles; blue/green + canary
