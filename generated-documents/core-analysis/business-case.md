- **Phase 2 - Core Development:** $391,000 (31%)
- **Phase 3 - Advanced Features:** $293,000 (23%)
- **Phase 4 - Testing & QA:** $196,000 (15%)
- **Phase 5 - Deployment:** $98,000 (8%)

#### **Investment Breakdown by Category**

### **Detailed ROI Calculation Methodology**

#### **ROI Formula and Components**
```
ROI = (Net Annual Benefits - Annual Investment) / Total Investment × 100

Where:
- Net Annual Benefits = $2,300,000 (Year 1)
- Annual Investment = $95,000 (ongoing operational costs)
- Total Investment = $1,275,000 (initial capital investment)

ROI Calculation:
ROI = ($2,300,000 - $95,000) / $1,275,000 × 100 = 172.9%

Conservative ROI (excluding operational costs):
ROI = $2,300,000 / $1,275,000 × 100 = 180.4%

Reported ROI (Net Benefit / Investment):
ROI = ($2,300,000 - $1,275,000) / $1,275,000 × 100 = 80.4%
```

#### **Payback Period Calculation**
```
Simple Payback = Initial Investment / Annual Net Cash Flow
Simple Payback = $1,275,000 / $2,205,000 = 0.58 years (6.9 months)

Discounted Payback (10% discount rate):
Month 6: Cumulative NPV = $1,050,000
Month 7: Cumulative NPV = $1,275,000 (breakeven achieved)
Discounted Payback = 7 months
```

#### **Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**
```
NPV = Σ [Cash Flow(t) / (1 + r)^t] - Initial Investment

Assumptions:
- Discount Rate (r) = 10% (organizational WACC)
- Time Period = 5 years
- Annual Cash Flows = $2,205,000 (Year 1), escalating 3% annually

NPV Calculation:
Year 0: -$1,275,000 (initial investment)
Year 1: $2,205,000 / (1.10)^1 = $2,004,545
Year 2: $2,271,150 / (1.10)^2 = $1,876,818
Year 3: $2,339,285 / (1.10)^3 = $1,757,891
Year 4: $2,409,463 / (1.10)^4 = $1,646,543
Year 5: $2,481,747 / (1.10)^5 = $1,541,892

NPV = $8,827,689 - $1,275,000 = $7,552,689
```

#### **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
```
IRR = Discount rate where NPV = 0
Calculated IRR = 173.2%

This exceptionally high IRR indicates the project generates returns
far exceeding the organization's cost of capital (10%).
