- Documentation and guidance materials
- User interfaces and dashboards
- Integration components
- Deployment and operational processes

### Definitions
- **Change:** Any addition, modification, or removal of approved, supported, or baselined ICT Governance Framework components.
- **Change Management:** The process of requesting, analyzing, approving, implementing, and reviewing changes.
- **Change Control Board (CCB):** A group responsible for reviewing and approving changes.
- **Emergency Change:** A change that must be implemented immediately to resolve a critical issue.
- **Change Request (CR):** A formal request to alter some aspect of the ICT Governance Framework.
- **Configuration Item (CI):** Any component that needs to be managed to deliver the ICT Governance Framework.
