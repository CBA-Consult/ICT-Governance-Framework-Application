## Introduction

This Communication Management Plan defines the framework for effective communication during the ICT Governance Framework Implementation project. It outlines who needs what information, when they need it, how it will be provided, and by whom.

### Purpose

The purpose of this Communication Management Plan is to:

- Identify and document communication needs of project stakeholders
