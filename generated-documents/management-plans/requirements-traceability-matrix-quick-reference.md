## Purpose

This quick reference guide provides project managers, business analysts, and stakeholders with essential information for using and maintaining the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) effectively.

---

## RTM Structure Overview

### Main Sections

1. **Governance Requirements Traceability** - High-level governance requirements (GR-001 to GR-015)
2. **Business Objectives Traceability** - Business objectives mapping (BO-001 to BO-014)
3. **Detailed Requirements Traceability** - Comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements
4. **Document Coverage Analysis** - Coverage metrics and document mapping
5. **Requirement Validation Status** - Quality metrics and validation results
6. **Implementation Roadmap Traceability** - Phased implementation planning

### Key Columns

| Column | Description | Usage |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **REQ ID** | Unique requirement identifier | Use for cross-referencing and impact analysis |
| **Description** | Brief requirement description | Quick understanding of requirement purpose |
| **Source Document** | Originating document | Locate detailed requirement information |
| **Document Section** | Specific section and line numbers | Direct navigation to requirement details |
| **Priority** | MoSCoW priority level | Implementation planning and resource allocation |
| **Business Objective** | Linked business objectives | Validate business value and alignment |
| **Design Artefacts** | Related design documents | Track design completion and dependencies |
| **Code Modules** | Implementation components | Monitor development progress |
| **Test Cases** | Associated test cases | Ensure testing coverage |
| **Status** | Current requirement status | Track progress and completion |

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Impact Analysis

**Scenario:** A stakeholder requests a change to a business objective.

**Steps:**
1. Locate the business objective in the "Business Objectives Traceability" section
2. Identify all supporting governance requirements
3. Find detailed requirements in the "Detailed Requirements Traceability" section
4. Review affected design artifacts, code modules, and test cases
5. Assess implementation impact using the "Implementation Roadmap Traceability"

**Example:**
```
Change Request: Modify BO-001 (Value-Driven Technology Leadership)
Impacted Requirements: GR-001, GR-003, GR-004, GR-009, FR-GOV-001, FR-GOV-003, FR-FIN-001, FR-FIN-003
Affected Artifacts: Governance Council Charter, Decision Framework, Budget Framework, ROI Framework
Implementation Impact: Phase 1A, Phase 2A, Phase 3A
```

### 2. Requirements Coverage Validation

**Scenario:** Verify all requirements are properly documented and traced.

**Steps:**
1. Review "Document Coverage Analysis" section
2. Check "Traceability Coverage Metrics" for 100% coverage
3. Validate "Requirements Quality Metrics" meet targets
4. Review "Gap Analysis Results" for any missing links

**Key Metrics:**
- Requirements → Business Objectives: 100%
- Requirements → Document Sections: 100%
- Requirements → Design Artifacts: 100%
- Requirements → Test Cases: 100%

### 3. Implementation Planning

**Scenario:** Plan development phases and resource allocation.

**Steps:**
1. Review "Implementation Roadmap Traceability" section
2. Identify phase dependencies
3. Allocate resources based on requirement priorities
4. Track progress using status updates

**Phase Structure:**
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-20):** Foundation requirements
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 21-40):** Core functionality
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 41-65):** Advanced features

### 4. Test Planning

**Scenario:** Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all requirements.

**Steps:**
1. Locate requirement in detailed traceability section
2. Identify associated test case IDs
3. Verify test cases exist for all acceptance criteria
4. Plan test execution based on implementation phases

**Test Case Naming Convention:**
- `TC-[REQ-ID]-[Sequence]` (e.g., TC-FR-GOV-001-001)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Missing Traceability Links

**Symptoms:** Requirements without complete traceability information
**Resolution:**
1. Review source documents for missing information
2. Consult with requirement authors or stakeholders
3. Update RTM with complete traceability links
4. Validate updates with stakeholders

### Issue: Conflicting Requirements

**Symptoms:** Requirements with contradictory acceptance criteria
**Resolution:**
1. Document conflict in "Change Impact Analysis" section
2. Facilitate stakeholder discussion and resolution
3. Update requirements based on agreed resolution
4. Update RTM with resolved requirements

### Issue: Outdated Document References

**Symptoms:** Document section references that no longer exist
**Resolution:**
