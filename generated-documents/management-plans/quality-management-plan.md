- Documentation and guidance materials
- User interfaces and dashboards
- Integration components
- Deployment and operational processes

### Definitions
- **Quality:** The degree to which the ICT Governance Framework fulfills stated and implied needs of stakeholders.
- **Quality Management:** The coordinated activities to direct and control the organization with regard to quality.
- **Quality Assurance (QA):** The planned and systematic activities implemented to provide confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled.
- **Quality Control (QC):** The operational techniques and activities used to verify that quality requirements have been fulfilled.
- **Defect:** Any deviation from specified requirements or expectations.
- **Quality Metrics:** Quantifiable measurements used to track and assess quality performance.

## Quality Management Approach
