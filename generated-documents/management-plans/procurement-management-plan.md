## Introduction

### Purpose
This Procurement Management Plan establishes the framework for acquiring external products, services, and resources needed for the ICT Governance Framework Application. It defines the processes, roles, and responsibilities for procurement activities to ensure they are conducted efficiently, transparently, and in alignment with organizational objectives.

### Scope
This plan applies to all procurement activities related to the ICT Governance Framework Application, including:
- Software licenses and subscriptions
- Cloud services and infrastructure
- Consulting and professional services
- Technical support and maintenance services
- Training and certification services
- Hardware and equipment (if applicable)

### Definitions
- **Procurement:** The process of obtaining goods, services, or works from external sources.
- **Vendor:** An organization or individual that provides goods or services.
- **Contract:** A legally binding agreement between the organization and a vendor.
- **Statement of Work (SOW):** A document that defines the scope, deliverables, timeline, and acceptance criteria for work to be performed by a vendor.
- **Request for Proposal (RFP):** A document that solicits proposals from potential vendors.
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** A commitment between a service provider and the organization regarding service quality, availability, and responsibilities.

## Procurement Management Approach

### Procurement Philosophy
The ICT Governance Framework Application employs a procurement management approach based on the following principles:
- Strategic alignment with organizational objectives
- Value optimization through total cost of ownership analysis
- Risk-based decision making
- Transparent and ethical procurement practices
- Collaborative vendor relationships
- Compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies

### Procurement Strategy
The procurement strategy for the ICT Governance Framework Application will:
- Leverage existing enterprise agreements and preferred vendor relationships where appropriate
- Prioritize cloud-based solutions aligned with the organization's cloud strategy
- Balance the use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products with custom solutions
- Consider open-source solutions where they meet security and support requirements
- Establish long-term partnerships with strategic vendors
- Implement standardized procurement processes for efficiency and compliance

### Make-vs-Buy Decision Process
For each component of the ICT Governance Framework Application, a structured make-vs-buy analysis will be conducted:
1. Identify requirements and constraints
2. Evaluate internal capabilities and capacity
3. Research available market solutions
4. Analyze costs (development, acquisition, maintenance, support)
5. Assess strategic considerations (competitive advantage, intellectual property)
6. Evaluate risks (vendor dependency, integration complexity, security)
7. Make recommendation based on total value assessment
8. Document decision rationale
