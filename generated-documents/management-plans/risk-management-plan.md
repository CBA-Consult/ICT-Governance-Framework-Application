## Introduction

This Risk Management Plan defines the approach for identifying, analyzing, monitoring, and controlling risks for the ICT Governance Framework Implementation project. The plan outlines the processes, tools, and responsibilities for managing risks throughout the project lifecycle.

### Purpose

The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to:

- Establish a consistent approach for identifying and managing risks
- Define roles and responsibilities for risk management activities
- Outline the processes for risk identification, analysis, response planning, and monitoring
- Document risk thresholds and response strategies
- Provide templates and tools for risk documentation and tracking

### Scope

This Risk Management Plan applies to all activities, deliverables, and resources associated with the ICT Governance Framework Implementation project. It covers risks related to technology, compliance, operations, personnel, and strategic objectives.

## Risk Management Approach

The project will use a proactive approach to risk management, following the PMBOK Guide standards. The risk management process includes:

1. **Risk Identification**: Identifying and documenting risks that may affect the project
2. **Risk Analysis**: Assessing the probability and impact of identified risks
3. **Risk Response Planning**: Developing strategies and actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats
4. **Risk Monitoring and Control**: Tracking identified risks, monitoring residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating the effectiveness of risk responses

The risk management process will be iterative throughout the project lifecycle, with formal risk reviews conducted at key milestones and project phase transitions.

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Project Sponsor | - Approve the Risk Management Plan<br>- Review high-priority risks<br>- Approve risk response strategies for high-impact risks |
| Project Manager | - Develop and maintain the Risk Management Plan<br>- Lead risk identification sessions<br>- Assign risk owners<br>- Monitor and report on risk status<br>- Escalate risks as necessary |
| Risk Owner | - Develop and implement risk response strategies<br>- Monitor assigned risks<br>- Report on risk status to Project Manager |
| Project Team Member | - Identify risks in their area of responsibility<br>- Participate in risk assessment activities<br>- Implement assigned risk response actions |
| Stakeholders | - Participate in risk identification<br>- Provide input on risk impact assessment<br>- Support risk response implementation as needed |

## Risk Categories

Risks will be categorized to facilitate analysis and response planning. The main risk categories for this project include:

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Technology compatibility
   - System performance
   - Integration challenges
   - Technical standards compliance

2. **Organizational Risks**
   - Resource availability
   - Stakeholder engagement
   - Change management
   - Organizational process alignment

3. **Compliance and Regulatory Risks**
   - Regulatory requirements
   - Industry standards compliance
   - Legal constraints
   - Audit findings

4. **External Risks**
   - Vendor/supplier performance
   - Market conditions
   - Environmental factors
   - Third-party dependencies

5. **Project Management Risks**
   - Schedule management
   - Cost management
   - Scope management
   - Quality management
   - Communication management

## Risk Assessment Methodology

### Risk Probability

| Level | Description | Probability Range |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Very Low | <10% |
| 2 | Low | 10-30% |
| 3 | Medium | 30-50% |
| 4 | High | 50-70% |
| 5 | Very High | >70% |

### Risk Impact

| Level | Description | Impact Definition |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Very Low | Minimal impact on project objectives |
| 2 | Low | Minor impact on project objectives |
| 3 | Medium | Moderate impact on project objectives |
| 4 | High | Significant impact on project objectives |
| 5 | Very High | Critical impact on project objectives |

### Risk Priority Matrix

| Probability/Impact | Very Low (1) | Low (2) | Medium (3) | High (4) | Very High (5) |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Very High (5) | Medium | Medium | High | Very High | Very High |
| High (4) | Low | Medium | Medium | High | Very High |
| Medium (3) | Low | Low | Medium | Medium | High |
| Low (2) | Very Low | Low | Low | Medium | Medium |
| Very Low (1) | Very Low | Very Low | Low | Low | Medium |

### Risk Tolerance Thresholds

- **Very High (Red)**: Requires immediate attention and response. Must be reported to the Project Sponsor.
- **High (Orange)**: Requires a detailed response plan and regular monitoring. Reported to the Project Sponsor in status reports.
- **Medium (Yellow)**: Requires a response plan and periodic monitoring. Managed by the Project Manager.
- **Low (Green)**: Monitored periodically. Response plan may be developed at Project Manager's discretion.
- **Very Low (Blue)**: Documented and monitored as part of regular risk reviews.

## Risk Monitoring and Control

### Risk Review Schedule

| Review Type | Frequency | Participants |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Formal Risk Review | Monthly | Project Manager, Risk Owners, Key Stakeholders |
| Project Status Meetings | Weekly | Project Team |
| Milestone Reviews | At each milestone | Project Manager, Project Sponsor, Key Stakeholders |
| Ad-hoc Reviews | As needed | Based on risk triggering event |

### Risk Monitoring Tools

- Risk Register: Updated continuously to track the status of all identified risks
- Risk Dashboard: Visual representation of risk status, updated monthly
- Risk Triggers: Pre-defined conditions that indicate a risk is about to occur or has occurred

### Risk Reporting

- Weekly Status Report: Summary of top risks and their status
- Monthly Risk Report: Detailed analysis of all risks, response strategies, and trends
- Ad-hoc Risk Alerts: Immediate notification of triggered high-priority risks

## Risk Response Strategies

The project will use the following risk response strategies:

### For Threats (Negative Risks)

- **Avoid**: Eliminate the threat by removing the cause
- **Transfer**: Shift the impact and ownership of the risk to a third party
- **Mitigate**: Reduce the probability and/or impact of the risk
- **Accept**: Acknowledge the risk without taking action (for low-priority risks)

### For Opportunities (Positive Risks)

- **Exploit**: Ensure the opportunity is realized
- **Share**: Allocate ownership of the opportunity to a third party
- **Enhance**: Increase the probability and/or impact of the opportunity
- **Accept**: Take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs, without actively pursuing it

## Risk Register

The Risk Register is the primary tool for documenting and tracking risks. It includes:

- Risk ID and description
- Risk category
- Probability and impact assessment
- Risk priority
- Risk owner
- Response strategy
- Response actions
- Status and updates

The initial Risk Register is attached as Appendix A and will be updated throughout the project lifecycle.

## Risk Communication

### Internal Communication

- Risk status will be communicated in weekly project status meetings
- High-priority risks will be highlighted in all project communications
- Risk owners will report on their assigned risks during team meetings

### External Communication

- Significant risks that may affect project deliverables or timelines will be communicated to external stakeholders as appropriate
- The Project Sponsor will approve all external risk communications
- Vendor-related risks will be communicated to the relevant vendors according to contractual requirements
