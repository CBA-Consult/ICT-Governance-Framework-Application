**Project:** ICT Governance Framework Application  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Prepared by:** ICT Governance Project Team  
**Date:** August 7, 2025

## 1. Purpose

This Cost Management Plan defines the policies, processes, and tools for planning, estimating, budgeting, managing, and controlling costs throughout the lifecycle of the ICT Governance Framework Application project. The plan supports the project's goal of delivering a comprehensive, enterprise-grade governance platform that aligns with COBIT 2019, ITIL 4, ISO/IEC 38500, and emerging standards for AI governance and sustainability, while achieving a projected $2.3M annual value and 94% ROI.

---

## 2. Cost Management Approach

Cost management will be conducted in alignment with PMBOK 7th Edition, enhanced governance frameworks, and industry best practices. The approach includes:

* **Cost Estimation:** Use bottom-up and parametric estimation based on work breakdown structure (WBS), resource rates, governance tool licensing, and infrastructure requirements.
* **Cost Budgeting:** Aggregate estimated costs to establish an authorized baseline aligned with the $1.275M Year 1 investment plan.
* **Cost Control:** Monitor actuals versus estimates, manage variances, perform forecasting, and report regularly with governance dashboard integration.
* **Value Realization:** Track and measure cost benefits against the projected $2.3M annual value proposition.
