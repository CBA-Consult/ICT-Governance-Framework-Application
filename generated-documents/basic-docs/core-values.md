## Introduction

Our core values define the fundamental principles that guide every decision, action, and initiative within the ICT Governance Framework Application project. These values serve as our ethical compass and cultural foundation, ensuring that our governance transformation not only delivers measurable business results but does so in a manner that reflects our commitment to excellence, integrity, and stakeholder value creation.

These values are not merely aspirational statements‚Äîthey are the practical guidelines that inform how we approach technology governance, stakeholder engagement, risk management, and innovation enablement.

## Values-Based Decision Making Framework

When faced with governance decisions, we apply our core values through the following framework:

### Decision Criteria Questions
1. **Value Creation:** Does this decision create measurable business value?
2. **Risk Intelligence:** Have we quantified and appropriately managed the risks?
3. **Ethical Impact:** Does this decision align with our ethical technology principles?
4. **Sustainability:** What is the environmental and long-term sustainability impact?
5. **Security Foundation:** Is security built into this decision from the ground up?
6. **Innovation Enablement:** Does this decision enable or constrain beneficial innovation?
7. **Stakeholder Benefit:** How does this decision serve our various stakeholders?
8. **Continuous Improvement:** What can we learn from this decision for future improvement?

### Values Conflict Resolution
When values appear to conflict (e.g., innovation versus security), we:
- Engage relevant stakeholders in transparent discussion
- Seek creative solutions that honor multiple values
- Make decisions based on overall stakeholder value and organizational mission
- Document the reasoning for future reference and learning

## Conclusion

These core values represent our commitment to transforming ICT governance from a compliance necessity into a strategic advantage. By living these values daily, we create a governance culture that not only delivers measurable business results but does so in a manner that serves all stakeholders and contributes positively to society.

Our success will be measured not only by the efficiency of our governance processes or the value of our technology investments, but by how consistently we demonstrate these values in every interaction, decision, and outcome.

**Together, these values form the ethical and cultural foundation that enables us to achieve our vision of world-class ICT governance that transforms technology into a strategic business enabler.**
