## Conclusion

Understanding the motivational drivers of different personas is fundamental to creating an ICT Governance Framework that not only functions effectively but inspires sustained engagement and excellence from all stakeholders. By aligning our design, implementation, and management strategies with these core motivations, we create an environment where governance becomes a source of professional fulfillment rather than bureaucratic burden.

The key to motivational success lies in recognizing that different personas are driven by different combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators, and designing flexible approaches that honor these differences while creating synergies that benefit the entire organization.

**Our commitment to motivation-centered design ensures that the ICT Governance Framework becomes a catalyst for professional growth, organizational excellence, and meaningful contribution, creating sustained engagement that drives long-term governance success.**
