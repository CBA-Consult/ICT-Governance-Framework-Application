## Critical Path Analysis Input

### Critical Path Components
1. **Infrastructure Foundation** (8 weeks) → 
2. **Risk Management Framework** (30 weeks) → 
3. **AI Governance Framework** (35 weeks) → 
4. **Zero Trust Security Architecture** (40 weeks) → 
5. **Integration Testing** (12 weeks) → 
6. **Production Deployment** (4 weeks)

**Total Critical Path Duration:** 129 weeks (approximately 2.5 years)

### Critical Path Dependencies
- Azure infrastructure must be completed before any domain implementation
- Risk management framework required before AI governance implementation
- Security architecture must be established before production deployment
- Integration testing depends on completion of all domain implementations

### Schedule Compression Opportunities
- **Fast-tracking:** Overlap non-dependent domain implementations
- **Crashing:** Add resources to critical path activities
- **Scope Reduction:** Defer non-critical features to later phases
- **Vendor Acceleration:** Premium rates for expedited delivery
