- **Milestone Reviews:** Validate duration estimates at major project milestones
- **Critical Path Focus:** Monitor critical path activities for schedule impact

### **Duration Variance Management**
- **±10% Variance:** Normal variance requiring no action
- **±20% Variance:** Investigate causes and implement corrective action
- **>20% Variance:** Escalate to steering committee and revise project schedule

### **Schedule Compression Techniques**
- **Fast Tracking:** Parallel execution of normally sequential activities
- **Crashing:** Adding resources to reduce activity duration
- **Scope Reduction:** Reducing activity scope while maintaining deliverable quality
- **Resource Reallocation:** Moving resources from non-critical to critical activities

### **Buffer Management**
- **Project Buffer:** 10% buffer included at project level (6.5 weeks)
- **Phase Buffers:** 5% buffer at end of each major phase
- **Critical Activity Buffer:** Individual buffers for high-risk activities
- **Resource Buffer:** Contingency resources for schedule recovery

---

## Quality Considerations

### **Duration vs. Quality Trade-offs**
- **Minimum Duration Standards:** Quality gates that cannot be compressed
- **Review and Approval Time:** Built-in time for stakeholder reviews
- **Rework Allowance:** Expected rework time based on historical data
- **Testing Adequacy:** Sufficient testing time to ensure quality deliverables

### **Duration Estimation Accuracy**
- **Early Estimates:** ±50% accuracy during initiation phase
- **Refined Estimates:** ±25% accuracy during planning phase
- **Detailed Estimates:** ±10% accuracy during execution phase
- **Final Estimates:** ±5% accuracy near activity completion
