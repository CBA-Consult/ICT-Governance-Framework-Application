## Executive Summary

The ICT Governance Framework Project aims to establish a comprehensive and unified governance structure for information and communication technology resources across the organization. This framework will enable better alignment between IT initiatives and business objectives, enhance security posture, improve regulatory compliance, and optimize IT resource utilization. By implementing standardized governance processes, the organization will gain better visibility, control, and decision-making capabilities over its IT investments and operations.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of the ICT Governance Framework project is to create a structured approach to governing IT resources that ensures technology investments support strategic business objectives while managing risks effectively. The framework will provide a clear set of policies, procedures, roles, and responsibilities for IT decision-making and oversight, establishing accountability and transparency in IT management.

## Business Case

### Business Need

The organization currently faces several challenges related to IT governance:

1. Fragmented decision-making processes for IT investments
2. Inconsistent application of security and compliance requirements
3. Limited visibility into IT resource utilization and effectiveness
4. Difficulty in prioritizing IT initiatives aligned with business strategy
5. Compliance gaps with industry regulations and standards
6. Inefficient management of cloud resources and security controls

### Expected Benefits

The implementation of the ICT Governance Framework is expected to deliver the following benefits:

| Benefit Category | Description | Measurable Outcome |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Strategic Alignment | Better alignment between IT initiatives and business objectives | 25% increase in IT projects directly supporting strategic business goals |
| Risk Management | Enhanced management of technology risks | 30% reduction in security incidents and compliance violations |
| Resource Optimization | Improved allocation and utilization of IT resources | 15% reduction in IT operational costs |
| Performance Improvement | More effective IT service delivery | 20% improvement in IT service quality metrics |
| Compliance | Strengthened regulatory compliance | 100% compliance with relevant standards and regulations |
| Decision-making | More informed and structured IT decision processes | 40% reduction in time to make IT investment decisions |

### Financial Benefits Analysis

Following the Framework Enhancement Plan, we have conducted a detailed analysis of financial benefits. The benefits are categorized into three main areas:
