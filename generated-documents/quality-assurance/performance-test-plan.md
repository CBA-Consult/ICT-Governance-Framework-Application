# Performance Test Plan

Version: 0.1 (Draft)
Date: 2025-08-08
Owner: QA & SRE

## Scope
Load, stress, soak, and scalability testing for core services and APIs based on Performance Requirements.

## Objectives
- Validate SLOs: availability, latency p95, throughput targets, error budgets.
- Identify bottlenecks and optimize cost/performance.

## Workloads
- CRUD on policies/controls; evidence submission; search/list endpoints; webhook spikes.
- Concurrency tiers: 500/1k/2k VUs; burst spikes 5k msg/s evidence ingestion.

## Environment
- Staging mirrors prod sizing; traffic shaping; feature flags aligned to prod.

## Tooling
- k6/Gatling for HTTP; custom workers for Service Bus; Azure Load Testing as optional harness.

## Metrics & Acceptance
- Pass if p95 latencies within thresholds for 3 consecutive runs; error rate < 0.1%; no sustained saturation.

## Reporting
- Dashboards in Grafana/App Insights; test reports archived; JIRA defects created with traces.
