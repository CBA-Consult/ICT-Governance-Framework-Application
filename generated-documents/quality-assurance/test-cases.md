- Traceability: link to Requirement ID (REQ-xxx) and User Story (US-xxx)
- Priority: P0/P1/P2; Type: Functional/Integration/E2E/Negative
- Data: specify preconditions, test data sources, and cleanup

## Template
- Title
- Preconditions
- Steps
- Expected Results
- Postconditions
- Links: REQ, US, Defects

## Example
- ID: TC-POL-001
- Title: Create a policy (happy path)
- Preconditions: User with role PolicyAuthor; system online
- Steps: 1) POST /policies with valid payload 2) GET /policies/{id}
- Expected: 201 Created; resource retrievable; fields persisted
- Links: REQ-GOV-CRUD-01, US-PA-12

## Non-Functional
- Performance: per Performance Test Plan cases
- Security: per Security Testing Guidelines

## Maintenance
- Version control test cases; review on major changes; auto-generate reports
