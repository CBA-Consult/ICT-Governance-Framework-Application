## Purpose
This document outlines how Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK) v3 aligned business analysis practices are systematically applied within the ICT Governance Framework. It establishes the foundation for consistent, structured business analysis activities that ensure requirements elicitation, analysis, validation, and traceability across all ICT governance initiatives.
