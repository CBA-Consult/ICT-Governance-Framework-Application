Excellent addition. Integrating Microsoft365DSC is the logical and essential next step to extend the governance framework beyond Azure infrastructure and into the Microsoft 365 SaaS platform. This creates a truly holistic cloud governance strategy.

By incorporating Microsoft365DSC, you apply the exact same Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and drift detection principles you're using for Azure (with Bicep/ARM) to your M365 tenant (Exchange, SharePoint, Teams, Security & Compliance, etc.).

Here is the updated framework, now fully integrating Microsoft365DSC.

Updated CBA Consult IT Management Framework (Integrated Azure + M365)

The framework now governs the entire Microsoft cloud estate by establishing two parallel, yet unified, pillars of "Governance as Code":

Azure Infrastructure Pillar: Managed by Bicep/ARM templates.

Microsoft 365 Tenant Pillar: Managed by Microsoft365DSC configurations.

Both pillars follow the same GitOps methodology, leveraging a single Git repository as the source of truth and a unified change management process.

How Microsoft365DSC Integrates Seamlessly

Microsoft365DSC doesn't just add to the framework; it completes it. It allows you to define, manage, and audit M365 settings as code, just as Bicep does for Azure resources.

Feature	Azure Governance	M365 Governance (with Microsoft365DSC)
Code Language	Bicep / ARM Templates	PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC)
Scope	VMs, VNETs, Storage, Azure Policy, IAM	Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Teams, Security Policies, Intune
Action	Deploy Infrastructure	Configure Tenant Settings
Drift Detection	Azure Policy & Resource Graph Scans	Start-M365DSCScan (Compares live tenant to code)
Enforcement	CI/CD Pipeline (az deployment group create)	CI/CD Pipeline (Start-M365DSCConfiguration)
Source of Truth	Git Repository (/azure-infra)	Git Repository (/m365-config)
The Updated, Fully Integrated Workflow

Here’s how the entire process works, from baseline to enforcement, across both Azure and M365.

1. Establish the "Golden State" Baseline:

For Azure: Your existing process of defining Bicep templates and Azure Policies remains. This is your baseline for infrastructure.

For Microsoft 365 (New Step):

Use Microsoft365DSC to generate a complete export of your current M365 tenant's configuration. This is a powerful feature that reverse-engineers your live settings into PowerShell DSC code.

Review and refine this exported code. Remove any temporary or incorrect settings. This sanitized code becomes your M365 "Golden State."

2. Centralize in a Single Git Repository:

Commit both your Bicep templates and your newly exported M365 DSC configurations to your central Git repository. A good structure would be:

Generated code
/git-repo
├── /azure-infra
│   ├── networking.bicep
│   └── compute.bicep
├── /m365-config
│   ├── ExchangeOnline.ps1
│   ├── Teams.ps1
│   └── SecurityAndCompliance.ps1
└── azure-pipelines.yml


3. Automate Continuous Drift Detection (The Audit Loop):

Set up a scheduled CI/CD pipeline (e.g., running nightly in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions) that performs two key audit tasks:

Azure Drift Scan: Uses Azure Resource Graph/Policy to compare deployed resources against the Bicep templates in Git.

M365 Drift Scan: Executes Start-M365DSCScan. This command reads the "Golden State" M365 configuration from your Git repo and compares it to your live tenant, generating a detailed HTML report showing any drift (e.g., a new mail flow rule created manually, a sharing policy that was changed).

Any drift detected by either process triggers an alert, a work item, and a report for the governance team.

4. Enforce Governance-Approved Changes (The Control Loop):

A change is required (e.g., a new Azure subnet needs to be created, or guest access in a specific Microsoft Team needs to be disabled).

The developer/admin does NOT make the change in the portal. Instead, they:

Create a new feature branch in Git.

Modify the relevant code file (a .bicep file for the Azure change, or a .ps1 DSC file for the M365 change).

Create a Pull Request (PR) to merge the change into the main branch.

The PR is the Governance Gate. It enforces peer review and can trigger automated validation pipelines.

Upon PR approval and merge:

An Azure deployment pipeline triggers, running az deployment group create to apply the Bicep template.

An M365 deployment pipeline triggers, running Start-M365DSCConfiguration to apply the desired state to the M365 tenant, automatically correcting the setting.

Summary of the Upgraded Framework

By integrating Microsoft365DSC, you elevate your CBA Consult IT Management Framework from an Azure-specific solution to a comprehensive Microsoft Cloud Governance Platform. You now have a unified, automated, and auditable system for managing the configuration and compliance of both your foundational infrastructure (Azure) and your collaboration and productivity platform (M365).

This closes a critical governance gap and ensures that the same rigorous GitOps principles of review, approval, and automated enforcement apply to your entire cloud presence.
