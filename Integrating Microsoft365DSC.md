# Integrating Microsoft365DSC into the CBA Consult IT Management Framework

Integrating Microsoft365DSC marks a pivotal evolution in our governance framework, extending robust Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and drift detection principles from Azure infrastructure to the Microsoft 365 SaaS platform. This enhancement ensures comprehensive, automated governance across the full Microsoft cloud estate.

## Unified Governance-as-Code: The Three Pillars

Our updated framework establishes three parallel, unified pillars, each governed by the same GitOps methodologies and centralized in a single source of truth:

1. **Azure Infrastructure Pillar:**  
   Managed with Bicep/ARM templates.

2. **Microsoft 365 Tenant Pillar:**  
   Managed via Microsoft365DSC configurations.

3. **Application Governance Pillar:**  
   Managed through the Employee App Store and security integration.

All pillars utilize a single Git repository, enforcing consistent change management, peer review, and automation.

## Microsoft365DSC: Completing the Framework

Microsoft365DSC empowers you to define, manage, and audit Microsoft 365 tenant configurations as code—mirroring the IaC approach already used for Azure. This ensures consistent governance, automated enforcement, and reliable drift detection across platforms.

| Feature          | Azure Governance          | M365 Governance (Microsoft365DSC)                | Application Governance                |
|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Code Language**| Bicep / ARM Templates    | PowerShell DSC                                   | C#/.NET Core (APIs), React (UI)       |
| **Scope**        | VMs, VNETs, Storage, IAM | Exchange, SharePoint, Teams, Security, Intune    | App Catalog, Validation, Shadow IT    |
| **Actions**      | Deploy Infrastructure    | Configure Tenant Settings                        | Manage App Lifecycle                  |
| **Drift Detection**| Policy & Resource Graph| Start-M365DSCScan                                | SIEM/CAS Discovery                    |
| **Enforcement**  | az deployment group      | Start-M365DSCConfiguration                       | CI/CD Pipeline                        |
| **Source of Truth**| /azure-infra           | /m365-config                                     | /app-governance                       |

## Integrated Workflow: Baseline to Enforcement

1. **Establish the "Golden State" Baseline**
   - **Azure:** Define infrastructure using Bicep templates and Azure Policies.
   - **Microsoft 365:**  
     - Export current tenant configuration using Microsoft365DSC.
     - Refine exported code to remove temporary or incorrect settings, creating your “Golden State”.

2. **Centralize in a Single Git Repository**
   ```
   /git-repo
   ├── /azure-infra
   │   ├── networking.bicep
   │   └── compute.bicep
   ├── /m365-config
   │   ├── ExchangeOnline.ps1
   │   ├── Teams.ps1
   │   └── SecurityAndCompliance.ps1
   ├── /app-governance
   │   ├── /app-store
   │   ├── /validation-workflow
   │   └── /security-integration
   └── azure-pipelines.yml
   ```

3. **Automate Continuous Drift Detection**
   - **Azure:** Resource Graph and Policy scans detect infrastructure drift.
   - **M365:** Start-M365DSCScan compares tenant state to code, generating detailed reports.
   - **Apps:** SIEM/CAS scans detect unauthorized applications.

   Any drift triggers automated alerts, work items, and governance reports.

4. **Enforce Governance-Approved Changes**
   - All changes are made in code via feature branches and pull requests.
   - PRs act as governance gates, requiring peer review and automated validation.
   - Upon approval:
     - **Azure:** Triggers `az deployment group create`.
     - **M365:** Runs `Start-M365DSCConfiguration` to enforce desired state.
     - **Apps:** Updates catalog and validation workflows.

## Summary: A Comprehensive Microsoft Cloud Governance Solution

By integrating Microsoft365DSC and the Employee App Store with SIEM/CAS, the CBA Consult IT Management Framework evolves from an Azure-specific solution to a holistic governance platform for the entire Microsoft cloud ecosystem.

This approach closes governance gaps, ensures end-to-end automation, and enforces rigorous GitOps principles—providing robust, auditable, and scalable cloud management for infrastructure, SaaS, and applications alike.
