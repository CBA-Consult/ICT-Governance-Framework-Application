Retention policies help ensure you retain content as long as it required, but no longer. With information governance, you can take two approaches to retention. You can use organization-wide policies, and you can use label-driven policies applied manually by a user or automatically by trained models Microsoft 365.

Using organization-wide policies, you can choose to retain content for a specific time period or permanently delete content at the end of the retention period. Policies can apply to one or more locations where information is stored like Exchange Online, SharePoint Online and Microsoft Teams.

Label-driven policies enable users to contribute to the accuracy of your data retention implementation. Users can manually label their own content to classify it. You can also auto-apply labels to specific content to make things easier on users. As with organization-wide policies, you can choose to retain or delete content based on when it was created or last modified. In addition, you can base retention on when it was labeled or an event, such as an employee leaving the organization. Retention labels can be automatically applied to content containing sensitive data, specific words or phrases, or having certain metadata, or that it matches a trainable classifier.

<h2> Cusomter Scenarios</h2>

Here is some common scenarios Microsoft's solution for information governance can address:

Create an organization-wide retention policy to delete all Microsoft Teams communications older than seven days.
Review documents stored in a SharePoint document library prior to them being deleted because a retention policy expired.
Implement a 5-year retention policy where automatically labeled content will be kept five years and then automatically deleted.
