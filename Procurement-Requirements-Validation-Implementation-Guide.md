## Validation Framework Overview

### Validation Philosophy
The validation framework is built on the principle of "Validate Early, Validate Often, Validate Continuously" to ensure that procurement requirements are accurate, complete, feasible, and aligned with organizational objectives throughout the entire procurement lifecycle.

### Core Validation Principles
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Validate all aspects of procurement requirements
2. **Multi-Perspective Validation**: Incorporate technical, business, legal, and security perspectives
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from validation outcomes to improve processes
4. **Risk-Based Approach**: Focus validation efforts based on risk assessment
5. **Automation-Enhanced**: Leverage technology to improve validation efficiency and accuracy
6. **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Ensure all relevant stakeholders participate in validation

### Validation Scope
**Requirements Categories:**
- Functional requirements and capabilities
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
- Technical requirements and constraints
- Business requirements and objectives
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Integration and interoperability requirements
- Cost and budget requirements
- Timeline and delivery requirements
