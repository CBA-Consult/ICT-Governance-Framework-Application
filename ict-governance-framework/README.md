# ICT Governance & IT Management Framework

**[See: Repository Table of Contents](../Table-of-Contents.md)**

A comprehensive ICT Governance and IT Management Framework with advanced user management, role-based access control, and security features. This interactive dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for exploring governance, compliance, and management processes.

## Project Purpose

The framework and dashboard aim to:
- Provide a user-friendly interface for exploring the detailed governance, compliance, and management processes documented in the Markdown (.md) files.
- Serve as a central portal for stakeholders to access, understand, and implement the framework's policies, procedures, and best practices.
- Enable secure user management with role-based access control and comprehensive audit trails.
- Support workflow automation and compliance monitoring features aligned with the framework.

## Current Status

- **‚úÖ User Management System Complete:** Full authentication, authorization, and user management with RBAC
- **‚úÖ Security Features Implemented:** JWT authentication, session management, activity logging, and rate limiting
- **‚úÖ Backend Refactor Complete:** Modular Express API endpoints for Defender for Cloud Apps and user management
- **‚úÖ Database Schema Updated:** PostgreSQL tables for users, roles, permissions, sessions, and audit trails
- **‚úÖ API Integration:** Comprehensive REST API with authentication and authorization middleware
- **‚úÖ Frontend Authentication:** Login/register forms, protected routes, and user management interface
- **‚úÖ Documentation Source:** All authoritative content is maintained in the Markdown files at the root of this repository and referenced in the [Table of Contents](../Table-of-Contents.md)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### 1. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
cd ict-governance-framework
npm install
```

### 2. **Setup Environment**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database and JWT secrets
```

**Important Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/ict_governance_framework

# JWT Configuration (Generate strong secrets for production)
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your-super-secret-access-key-change-this-in-production
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secret-refresh-key-change-this-in-production

# API Configuration
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development

# Frontend Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```

### 3. **Setup Database**

```bash
# Create your PostgreSQL database
createdb ict_governance_framework

# Run the SQL schema file against your PostgreSQL database
psql -d ict_governance_framework -f db-schema.sql
```

### 4. **Start Backend**

```bash
node server.js
```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:4000`

### 5. **Start Frontend**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üìã Default Admin Account

After running the database schema, you can create a super admin account by registering through the UI or using the API directly. The first user should be assigned the `super_admin` role manually in the database.

### Option 1: Register through UI
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/auth?mode=register`
2. Fill out the registration form
3. After registration, manually update the user's role in the database:

```sql
-- Find your user ID
SELECT user_id, username, email FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Assign super_admin role
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id, assigned_by, assignment_reason)
VALUES ('YOUR_USER_ID', 'ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN', 'YOUR_USER_ID', 'Initial super admin setup');
```

### Option 2: Create directly via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "admin",
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "AdminPass123!",
    "firstName": "System",
    "lastName": "Administrator",
    "department": "IT",
    "jobTitle": "System Administrator"
  }'
```

Then assign the super_admin role using the SQL command above.
