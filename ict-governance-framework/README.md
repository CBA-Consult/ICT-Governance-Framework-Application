# ICT Governance & IT Management Framework Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard designed to visualize, navigate, and operationalize the comprehensive ICT Governance and IT Management Framework developed in this repository.

## Project Purpose

The dashboard aims to:
- Provide a user-friendly interface for exploring the detailed governance, compliance, and management processes documented in the Markdown (.md) files.
- Serve as a central portal for stakeholders to access, understand, and implement the framework's policies, procedures, and best practices.
- Enable future integration of reporting, benchmarking, and workflow automation features aligned with the framework.

## Current Status

- **First Draft:** The current dashboard is a prototype and does not yet reflect the depth, structure, or content of the full ICT Governance & IT Management Framework.
- **Placeholder Pages:** Most pages are placeholders and do not display meaningful or actionable information.
- **Documentation Source:** All authoritative content is maintained in the Markdown files at the root of this repository.

## Next Steps / Roadmap

To upgrade the dashboard to production quality and align it with the framework:

1. **Content Integration:**
	- Parse and render the Markdown documentation within the dashboard.
	- Organize content by framework domains, processes, and compliance requirements.

2. **UI/UX Enhancements:**
	- Design navigation and dashboards that reflect the structure of the framework.
	- Add search, filtering, and cross-referencing capabilities.

3. **Compliance & Reporting:**
	- Integrate compliance checklists, reporting tools, and benchmarking features.

4. **Automation & Workflows:**
	- Enable workflow automation for governance processes (e.g., registration, offboarding, audits).

5. **Stakeholder Feedback:**
	- Gather input from users to refine features and prioritize enhancements.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please see the main repository documentation for guidelines and priorities. Focus areas include:

**Note:** This dashboard is under active development. For authoritative framework content, refer to the Markdown files in the repository root.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
