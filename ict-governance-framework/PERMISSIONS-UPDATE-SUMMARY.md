## API Endpoint Protection

### Protected Endpoints
All notification system endpoints now require authentication and appropriate permissions:

#### Notification Endpoints (`/api/notifications`)
- `GET /` - Requires: `notification.read`
- `POST /` - Requires: `notification.create`
- `PATCH /:id/read` - Requires: `notification.read`
- `PUT /preferences` - Requires: `notification.read`

#### Alert Endpoints (`/api/alerts`)
- `GET /` - Requires: `alert.read`
- `POST /` - Requires: `alert.create`
- `PATCH /:id/acknowledge` - Requires: `alert.acknowledge`
- `PATCH /:id/resolve` - Requires: `alert.resolve`
- `PATCH /:id/escalate` - Requires: `alert.escalate`

#### Communication Endpoints (`/api/communication`)
- `GET /channels` - Requires: `communication.read`
- `POST /channels` - Requires: `communication.create`
- `POST /channels/:id/messages` - Requires: `communication.create`

#### Escalation Endpoints (`/api/escalations`)
- `GET /list` - Requires: `escalation.read`
- `POST /create` - Requires: `escalation.create`
- `POST /:id/action` - Requires: `escalation.manage`

#### Real-time Endpoints (`/api/realtime`)
- `GET /stream` - Requires: `realtime.connect`
- `POST /broadcast` - Requires: `realtime.broadcast`

#### Escalation Management (`/api/escalation-management`)
- `GET /service/status` - Requires: `escalation.read`
- `POST /service/start` - Requires: `escalation.manage`
- `POST /manual` - Requires: `escalation.create`

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Apply Database Updates
```bash
# Run the permissions update script
./apply-permissions-update.sh
```

### 2. Restart Application
```bash
# Restart your Node.js application to load new API routes
npm restart
# or
pm2 restart ict-governance-framework
```

### 3. Assign User Roles
Use the user management interface or SQL to assign appropriate roles:
```sql
-- Example: Assign IT Manager role to a user
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id, assigned_by, assignment_reason)
VALUES ('USER123', 'ROLE_IT_MANAGER', 'ADMIN_USER', 'IT management responsibilities');
```

### 4. Test Functionality
- Log in with different user roles
- Test notification system access
- Verify alert management capabilities
- Check communication features
- Test escalation workflows

## Security Benefits

### Enhanced Access Control
- **Granular Permissions**: Fine-grained control over notification system features
- **Role-Based Security**: Users only access features appropriate to their role
- **Audit Trail**: All permission assignments and usage are logged
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users receive minimal necessary permissions

### API Security
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **Permission Validation**: Each endpoint validates user permissions
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure

### Data Protection
- **User Isolation**: Users only see notifications and data appropriate to their role
- **Channel Security**: Communication channels respect privacy and access controls
- **Escalation Security**: Escalations follow proper authorization chains
- **Real-time Security**: Real-time connections are authenticated and authorized

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Permission Audits**: Quarterly review of user role assignments
2. **Access Reviews**: Monthly review of permission usage logs
3. **Role Updates**: Update role definitions as organizational needs change
4. **Security Monitoring**: Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

### Metrics to Track
- Permission usage patterns
- Failed authorization attempts
- Role assignment changes
- System access patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Denied**: Check user roles and permission assignments
2. **Authentication Failures**: Verify JWT token validity and user status
3. **Missing Features**: Ensure user has appropriate role assignments
4. **API Errors**: Check server logs for detailed error information

### Debug Queries
```sql
-- Check user's effective permissions
SELECT DISTINCT p.permission_name, p.display_name
FROM user_roles ur
JOIN role_permissions rp ON ur.role_id = rp.role_id
JOIN permissions p ON rp.permission_id = p.permission_id
WHERE ur.user_id = 'USER123' AND ur.is_active = TRUE;

-- Check role assignments
SELECT r.role_name, r.display_name, ur.assigned_at
FROM user_roles ur
JOIN roles r ON ur.role_id = r.role_id
WHERE ur.user_id = 'USER123' AND ur.is_active = TRUE;
```
