## 🚀 **ACTIVATION STEPS REQUIRED**

### Step 1: Apply Database Updates
```bash
cd ict-governance-framework

# Apply notification system schema
psql $DATABASE_URL -f db-notifications-schema.sql

# Apply permissions update
psql $DATABASE_URL -f db-permissions-update.sql

# OR use the automated script
./apply-permissions-update.sh
```

### Step 2: Verify Database Updates
```sql
-- Check notification permissions
SELECT permission_name, display_name 
FROM permissions 
WHERE permission_name LIKE 'notification.%' 
   OR permission_name LIKE 'alert.%' 
   OR permission_name LIKE 'escalation.%' 
   OR permission_name LIKE 'communication.%';

-- Check new roles
SELECT role_name, display_name, role_hierarchy_level 
FROM roles 
WHERE role_name IN ('system_administrator', 'it_support', 'notification_admin');

-- Check role-permission assignments
SELECT r.role_name, p.permission_name 
FROM role_permissions rp
JOIN roles r ON rp.role_id = r.role_id
JOIN permissions p ON rp.permission_id = p.permission_id
WHERE p.permission_name LIKE 'notification.%'
ORDER BY r.role_hierarchy_level DESC, p.permission_name;
```

### Step 3: Assign Users to Roles
```sql
-- Example: Assign IT Manager role to a user
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id, assigned_by, assignment_reason)
VALUES ('USER123', 'ROLE_IT_MANAGER', 'ADMIN_USER', 'IT management responsibilities');

-- Example: Assign System Administrator role
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id, assigned_by, assignment_reason)
VALUES ('USER456', 'ROLE_SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR', 'ADMIN_USER', 'System administration duties');

-- Example: Assign Notification Administrator role
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id, assigned_by, assignment_reason)
VALUES ('USER789', 'ROLE_NOTIFICATION_ADMIN', 'ADMIN_USER', 'Notification system management');
```

### Step 4: Restart Application
```bash
# Restart Node.js application to load new API routes
npm restart
# OR
pm2 restart ict-governance-framework
```

### Step 5: Test Notification System Access
```bash
# Test API endpoints with different user roles
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:4000/api/notifications

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:4000/api/alerts

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:4000/api/escalations/list
```

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### Common Issues After Update

#### Issue: "Permission denied" errors
**Cause**: User doesn't have required permissions
**Solution**: 
```sql
-- Check user's roles
SELECT r.role_name FROM user_roles ur 
JOIN roles r ON ur.role_id = r.role_id 
WHERE ur.user_id = 'USER123' AND ur.is_active = TRUE;

-- Check role permissions
SELECT p.permission_name FROM role_permissions rp
JOIN permissions p ON rp.permission_id = p.permission_id
WHERE rp.role_id = 'ROLE_IT_MANAGER' AND rp.is_active = TRUE;
```

#### Issue: "Table does not exist" errors
**Cause**: Notification schema not applied
**Solution**: Run `psql $DATABASE_URL -f db-notifications-schema.sql`

#### Issue: API endpoints return 404
**Cause**: Application not restarted after updates
**Solution**: Restart Node.js application

#### Issue: Users can't see notification features
**Cause**: Frontend permission checks failing
**Solution**: Verify JWT token contains role information and frontend checks correct permissions

## 📞 **SUPPORT RESOURCES**
