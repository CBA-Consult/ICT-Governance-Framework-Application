## API Integration

### Permission Checking
```javascript
// Check user's dashboard permissions
const response = await fetch('/api/dashboard-access/permissions', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const permissions = await response.json();
// permissions.data.dashboardAccess contains boolean flags for each dashboard type
```

### Granting Access
```javascript
// Grant dashboard access to users
const response = await fetch('/api/dashboard-access/grant', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userIds: ['user1', 'user2'],
    dashboardTypes: ['executive', 'operational'],
    reason: 'Quarterly review access',
    expiresAt: '2024-12-31T23:59:59Z'
  })
});
```

### Audit Logging
```javascript
// Get audit logs
const response = await fetch('/api/dashboard-access/audit?startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-12-31', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const auditLogs = await response.json();
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- All dashboard access requires valid authentication token
- Permissions are checked at both API and component levels
- Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- Session-based permission caching with automatic refresh

### Audit and Monitoring
- All access attempts are logged with user, timestamp, and outcome
- Failed access attempts are tracked for security monitoring
- Audit logs include IP addresses and user agents
- Regular audit log review recommended

### Data Protection
- No sensitive dashboard data cached in client-side storage
- Secure API communication with proper headers
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
