# User Profile Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of backend endpoints for user profile management in the ICT Governance Framework. The implementation provides comprehensive self-service capabilities for users to manage their profiles, preferences, security settings, and sessions.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New API File: `/api/profile.js`

Created a dedicated API module for user profile management with the following endpoints:

#### Core Profile Management
- **GET /api/profile** - Get complete user profile
- **PUT /api/profile** - Update profile information
- **PUT /api/profile/preferences** - Update user preferences

#### Security Management
- **PUT /api/profile/password** - Change password with security validations
- **GET /api/profile/sessions** - View active sessions
- **DELETE /api/profile/sessions/:sessionId** - Revoke specific session
- **DELETE /api/profile/sessions** - Revoke all other sessions

#### File Management
- **POST /api/profile/upload-picture** - Upload profile picture

#### Activity Tracking
- **GET /api/profile/activity** - View user activity log

### 2. Enhanced Existing Endpoints

#### Updated `/api/auth/me`
- Added `profilePictureUrl` field to response
- Added documentation note directing users to `/api/profile` for complete profile data

### 3. Server Configuration Updates

#### Updated `server.js`
- Added profile router registration: `app.use('/api/profile', profileRouter)`
- Added static file serving for uploads: `app.use('/uploads', express.static(...))`

#### Created Upload Directory Structure
- Created `/uploads/profile-pictures/` directory
- Added `.gitkeep` file to ensure directory tracking

## Key Features Implemented

- Role and permission information
- Active session count
- Metadata and preferences

### 2. Self-Service Profile Updates

- Merge functionality to preserve existing preferences
- Validation for preference structure and values
- Support for theme, language, timezone, notifications, and dashboard settings

### 4. Robust Password Management
- Current password verification

- Password history tracking (prevents reuse of last 5 passwords)
- Automatic session invalidation on password change
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)

### 5. Profile Picture Management
- File upload with multer middleware

- File size limits (5MB)
- Automatic old file cleanup
- Unique filename generation
- Static file serving

### 6. Session Management

- Automatic cleanup of old files
- Path traversal protection

### 5. Session Security
- Session tracking and management
- Device and IP information logging
- Session expiration handling

## Database Integration

### 1. Existing Schema Utilization
- Leverages existing `users` table structure
- Uses `user_sessions` table for session management
- Integrates with `user_activity_log` for audit trail
- Utilizes `password_history` for security compliance

### 2. JSONB Fields
- `preferences` field for flexible user settings
- `metadata` field for additional user information
- Efficient querying and updating of JSON data

### 3. Relational Data
- Manager relationships
- Role and permission associations
- Session tracking
- Activity logging

## Error Handling

### 1. Consistent Error Responses
- Standardized error format across all endpoints
- Specific error codes for different scenarios
- Detailed validation error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes

### 2. Comprehensive Error Coverage
- Validation errors
- Authentication/authorization errors
- File upload errors
- Database errors
- Business logic errors

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Efficient Queries
- Single query for complete profile data
- Optimized joins for related data
- Pagination for activity logs
- Indexed fields for fast lookups

### 2. File Handling
- Streaming file uploads
- Automatic cleanup of old files
- Efficient static file serving
- File size and type validation

### 3. Session Management
- Efficient session queries
- Bulk session operations
- Proper session cleanup

## Frontend Integration

### 1. RESTful API Design
- Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- Consistent request/response formats
- Proper content types
- CORS support

### 2. Frontend-Friendly Features
