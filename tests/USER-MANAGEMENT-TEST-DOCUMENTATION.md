## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js and npm installed
2. Playwright installed (`npx playwright install`)
3. ICT Governance Framework application running on `http://localhost:3000`

### Execution Methods

#### Method 1: Using the Test Runner Script

```bash
./tests/run-user-management-tests.sh
```

#### Method 2: Direct Playwright Command

```bash
npx playwright test tests/user-management.spec.ts --reporter=html
```

#### Method 3: Specific Test Categories

```bash
# Run only button responsiveness tests
npx playwright test tests/user-management.spec.ts -g "New User Button Visibility and Responsiveness"

# Run only form validation tests
npx playwright test tests/user-management.spec.ts -g "Form Validation"

# Run only successful creation tests
npx playwright test tests/user-management.spec.ts -g "Successful User Creation"
```

### Test Configuration

The tests are configured to:
- Run against `http://localhost:3000`
- Take screenshots on failure
- Record videos on failure
- Generate HTML reports
- Support multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

## Expected Results

```

### Test Reports

After running tests, view the detailed HTML report:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Application not running**: Ensure the ICT Governance Framework is running on port 3000
2. **Authentication failures**: Verify admin user credentials are correct
3. **Database issues**: Ensure test database is properly configured
4. **Network timeouts**: Check network connectivity and increase timeout values if needed

### Debug Mode

Run tests in debug mode for step-by-step execution:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/user-management.spec.ts --debug
```

### Headed Mode

Run tests with visible browser for debugging:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/user-management.spec.ts --headed
```

## Maintenance

### Updating Tests

When updating the user management functionality:

1. Update test data in `user-management-helpers.ts`
2. Add new test cases to `user-management.spec.ts`
3. Update helper functions as needed
4. Update this documentation

### Test Data Cleanup

The test suite includes automatic cleanup functions to remove test data after execution. If manual cleanup is needed:

```typescript
await cleanupTestUsers(page, ['testuser1', 'testuser2']);
```

## Continuous Integration

These tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run User Management Tests
  run: |
    npm install
    npx playwright install
    npx playwright test tests/user-management.spec.ts
```

## Security Considerations

- Test data uses non-production credentials
- Sensitive information is not logged
- Test users are automatically cleaned up
- Tests run in isolated environment

## Performance Considerations

- Loading state verification
- Timeout configurations for slow networks
- Parallel execution support

## Accessibility Compliance

The tests verify compliance with:
- WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Keyboard navigation standards
- Screen reader compatibility
- ARIA label requirements

## Browser Compatibility

Tests are configured to run on:
- âœ… Chromium (Chrome/Edge)
- âœ… Firefox
- âœ… WebKit (Safari)
- âœ… Mobile viewports
