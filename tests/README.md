## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Validate Environment

```bash
npm run test:validate-env
```

### 2. Run Tests

```bash
# Using npm scripts
npm run test:user-management

./tests/run-user-management-tests.sh

# Using Playwright directly
npx playwright test tests/user-management.spec.ts
```

### 3. View Results

```bash
npm run test:report
```

## 🛠 Development Commands

```bash
# Run tests with visible browser
npm run test:user-management:headed

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:user-management:debug

# Run all tests
npm test

# Generate and view test report
npm run test:report
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Playwright installed (`npx playwright install`)
- ICT Governance Framework running on `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔧 Configuration

The tests are configured in `playwright.config.ts` with:
- Base URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Multiple browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Screenshot and video capture on failure
- HTML reporting

## 📊 Test Coverage

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of:

- **Functional Testing**: All user creation workflow steps
- **UI Testing**: Button responsiveness and modal behavior
- **Validation Testing**: Form validation rules and error handling
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow with backend
- **Accessibility Testing**: Keyboard navigation and ARIA compliance
- **Error Handling**: Network failures and edge cases

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests fail with "Application not running"**
   ```bash
   cd ict-governance-framework
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Playwright not installed**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

3. **Permission errors on scripts**
   ```bash
   chmod +x tests/run-user-management-tests.sh
   chmod +x tests/validate-test-environment.js
   ```

### Debug Mode

For step-by-step debugging:
```bash
npm run test:user-management:debug
```

### Headed Mode

To see tests running in browser:
```bash
npm run test:user-management:headed
```

## 📈 Continuous Integration

These tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
- name: Run User Management Tests
  run: |
    npm install
    npx playwright install
    npm run test:user-management
```

2. Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
3. Add appropriate documentation
4. Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
5. Include cleanup for any test data created
