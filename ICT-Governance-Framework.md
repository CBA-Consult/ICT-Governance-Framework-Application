## Annual Benchmarking Framework

### Purpose and Scope
The organization implements a comprehensive Annual Benchmarking Framework to drive continuous excellence and learning by systematically comparing governance practices against industry standards. This framework aligns with the ICT Governance Framework Strategic Analysis recommendations and ensures our governance practices remain at the forefront of industry best practices.

### Benchmarking Methodology
The annual benchmarking follows a structured five-phase approach:

1. **Planning and Preparation (January-February)**: Define scope, select industry standards, establish partnerships, and allocate resources
2. **Data Collection and Assessment (March-May)**: Conduct internal assessments, collect industry benchmarking data, and evaluate standards alignment
3. **Analysis and Gap Identification (June-July)**: Perform gap analysis, identify improvement opportunities, and prioritize initiatives
4. **Improvement Planning and Implementation (August-October)**: Develop and execute improvement plans based on benchmarking findings
5. **Review and Continuous Improvement (November-December)**: Assess results, optimize processes, and plan for next year

### Industry Standards Coverage
The benchmarking framework evaluates alignment with leading industry standards:
* **COBIT 2019**: Information and Technology Governance
* **ITIL 4**: IT Service Management
* **ISO/IEC 38500**: IT Governance
* **TOGAF**: Enterprise Architecture
* **FAIR**: Risk Management
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Cybersecurity Governance
* **COSO**: Internal Control
* **Emerging Standards**: AI Ethics, ESG Technology Governance, Zero Trust Security

### Governance and Oversight
* **ICT Governance Council**: Provides oversight, approves scope and methodology, reviews results, and approves improvement initiatives
* **Domain Owners**: Participate in assessments, support implementation, and monitor domain-specific improvements
* **Technology Stewards**: Collect data, support analysis, and implement technical improvements

### Success Metrics and Monitoring
The framework includes comprehensive metrics for measuring benchmarking effectiveness, performance improvement, and business value realization. Regular monitoring ensures continuous improvement and alignment with strategic objectives.
