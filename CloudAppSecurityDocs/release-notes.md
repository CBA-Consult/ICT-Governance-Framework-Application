> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Threat protection product names from Microsoft are changing. Read more about this and other updates [here](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/?p=91813). We'll be using the new names in future releases.

>[!NOTE]
>**Deprecation reminder:** In [release 198](#cloud-app-security-release-198), we added a new checkbox to [Session policies](session-policy-aad.md) that treats any data that can't be scanned as a match for the policy. This feature replaces both **Treat encrypted as match**, and **Treat files that cannot be scanned as match**, in addition to adding new functionality. New policies will contain the new checkbox by default, deselected by default. Pre-existing policies will be migrated to the new checkbox on May 30. Policies with either or both options selected will have the new option selected by default; all other policies will have it deselected.

## Cloud App Security release 200, 201, and 202

May 30, 2021

- **Authentication Context (Step-Up Authentication) in public preview**  
We've added the ability to protect users working with proprietary and privileged assets by requiring Azure AD Conditional Access policies to be reassessed in the session. For example, if a change in IP address is detected because an employee in a highly sensitive session has moved from the office to the coffee shop downstairs, step-up can be configured to reauthenticate that user. For more information, see [Require step-up authentication (authentication context) upon risky action](tutorial-step-up-authentication.md).

## Cloud App Security release 199

## Cloud App Security release 165, 166, 167, and 168

Released February 16, 2020

- **New block unsanctioned apps with Microsoft Defender ATP**  
Cloud App Security has extended its native integration with Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP). You can now block access to apps marked as unsanctioned using Microsoft Defender ATP's network protection capability. For more information, see [Block access to unsanctioned cloud apps](mde-integration.md#block-access-to-unsanctioned-cloud-apps).

- **New OAuth app anomaly detection**  
We've expanded our current capability to detect malicious OAuth app consent. The new detection is now available out-of-the-box and automatically enabled to alert you when a potentially malicious OAuth app is authorized in your environment. This detection leverages Microsoft security research and threat intelligence expertise to identify malicious apps.

- **Log collector updates**  
The Docker-based log collector was enhanced with the following important updates:

  - Container OS version upgrade

  - Java security vulnerabilities patches

  - Syslog service upgrade

  - Stability and performance improvements

    We strongly recommend that you upgrade your environment to this new version. For more information, see [Log collector deployment modes](discovery-docker.md#deployment-modes).

- **Support for ServiceNow New York**  
Cloud App Security now supports the latest version (New York) of ServiceNow. To learn about securing ServiceNow, see [Connect ServiceNow to Microsoft Cloud App Security](connect-servicenow-to-microsoft-cloud-app-security.md).

- **Enhanced detection logic: Impossible travel**  
We've updated the detection logic for impossible travel to provide enhanced coverage and better accuracy. As part of this update, we also updated the detection logic for [impossible travel from corporate networks](anomaly-detection-policy.md#impossible-travel).

- **New threshold for activity policies**  
We've added a threshold for [activity policies](user-activity-policies.md) to help you manage the volume of alerts. Policies that trigger a large volume of matches for several days are automatically disabled. If you receive a system alert about this, you should try refining policies by adding additional filters or, if you're using policies for reporting purposes, consider saving them as queries instead.
