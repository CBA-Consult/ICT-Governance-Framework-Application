  - API tokens â€“ generate and manage your own [API tokens](api-authentication.md)  to integrate Cloud App Security with third-party software using our RESTful APIs.
  - SIEM agents â€“ [SIEM integration](siem.md) was previously located directly under "Settings", now available as a tab in Security Extensions.
  - External DLP (Preview) â€“ Cloud App Security allows you to [leverage existing investments in third-party classification systems](icap-stunnel.md) such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions, and enables you to scan the contents of cloud applications using existing deployments running in your environment. Contact your account manager to join the preview.

- **Automatically sanction/unsanction:** New App detection policies give Cloud Discovery the ability to automatically set apps with Sanctioned/Unsanctioned label. This gives you the ability to automatically identify apps that are in violation of your organization's policy and regulations and add them to the generated blocking script.
- **Cloud App Security file labels:** You can now apply Cloud App Security file labels to now provide more insight into the files it scans. For each file scanned by Cloud App Security DLP, you can now know if the files were blocked from being inspected because they were encrypted or corrupted. For instance, you can set up policies to alert and quarantine password protected files that are shared externally. This feature is available for files scanned after July 3, 2017.

    You can filter for these files by using the filter **Classification labels** > **Cloud App Security**:

  - **Azure RMS encrypted** â€“ files whose content wasn't inspected because they have Azure RMS encryption set.
  - **Password encrypted** â€“ files whose content wasn't inspected because they're password protected by the user.
  - **Corrupt file** â€“ files whose content wasn't inspected because their content couldn't be read.

- **User insights**: The investigation experience was upgraded to enable out-of-the-box insights about the acting user. With a single click, you can now see a comprehensive overview of the users from the Activity drawer, Insights include which location they connected from, how many open alerts are they're involved with, and their metadata information.
- **App connector insights:** Under **App Connectors**, each connected app now includes an app drawer in the table for easier drill-down into its status. Details that are provided include when the App connector was connected and last health check on the connector. You can also monitor the status of DLP scanning on each app: the total number of files inspected by DLP and the status of the real-time scans (requested scans vs. actual scans). You'll be able to tell if the rate of files scanned by Cloud App Security in real time is lower than the requested number, and whether your tenant might be exceeding its capacity and experiencing a delay in the DLP results.

- **Cloud App Catalog customization:**

  - **App tags**: You can now create custom tags for apps. These tags can be used as filters for diving deeper into specific types of apps that you want to investigate. For example, custom watch list, assignment to a specific business unit, or custom approvals, such as "approved by legal".
  - **Custom notes**: As you review and assess the different applications that were discovered across your environment, you can now save your conclusions and insights in the Notes.
  - **Custom risk score**: You can now override the risk score of an app. For example, if the risk score of an app is 8 and it's a sanctioned app in your organization, you can change the risk score to 10 for your organization. You can also add notes to make the justification of the change clear when anyone reviews the app.

- **New log collector deployment mode:** We're starting to roll out a new deployment mode is now available for the log collector. In addition to the current virtual-appliance based deployment, the new Docker (container) based log collector can be installed as a package on Windows and Ubuntu machines both on-premises and in Azure. When using the Docker, the hosting machine is owned by the customer, who can freely patch and monitor it.

**Announcements:**

- The Cloud App Catalog now supports over 15,000 discoverable apps
- Compliance: Cloud App Security is officially SOC1/2/3 certified by Azure. For the full list of certifications, see [Compliance offerings](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/complianceofferings) and filter the results for Cloud App Security.

**Other improvements:**

- **Expected log formats:** The expected log format for Cloud Discovery logs now provides examples for both Syslog format and FTP format.
- **Log collector upload status:** You can now see the log collector status in the portal and troubleshoot errors faster using the in-portal status notifications and the system alerts.

### Cloud App Security release 99

Released June 18, 2017

**New Features**

- You can now require users to sign in again to all Office 365 and Azure AD apps. Require sign in again as a quick and effective remediation for suspicious user activity alerts and compromised accounts. You can find the new governance in the policy settings and the alert pages, next to the Suspend user option.
- You can now filter for **Add impersonation role assignment** activities in the Activity log. This activity enables you to detect when an admin has granted an **Application Impersonation** role to any user or system account, using the cmdlet **New-ManagementRoleAssignment**. This role allows the impersonator to perform operations by using the permissions associated with the impersonated account, instead of the permissions associated with the impersonator's account.

**Cloud Discovery Improvements:**

- Cloud Discovery data can now be enriched with Azure Active Directory username data. When you enable this feature, the username received in the discovery traffic logs will be matched and replaced by the Azure AD username. Enriching enables the following new features:
  - You can investigate Shadow IT usage by Azure Active Directory user.
  - You can correlate the discovered cloud app use with the API collected activities.
  - You can then create custom logs based on Azure AD user groups. For example, a Shadow IT report for a specific Marketing department.
- Improvements were made to the Juniper syslog parser. It now supports the welf and sd-syslog formats.
- Improvements were made to the Palo Alto parser for better application discovery.
- To verify that logs are being successfully uploaded, you can now see the status of your log collectors in the Cloud App Security portal.

**General improvements:**

- Built-in IP address tags and custom IP tags are now considered hierarchically, with custom IP tags taking precedence over built-in IP tags. For instance, if an IP address is tagged as **Risky** based on threat intelligence, but there's a custom IP tag that identifies it as **Corporate**, the custom category and tags will take precedence.

### Cloud App Security release 98

Released June 4, 2017

**Cloud Discovery updates:**

- Users can now perform advanced filtering on discovered apps. Filtering enables you to perform deep investigation. For example, filtering apps based on usage. Wow much upload traffic from discovered apps of certain types? How many users used certain categories of discovered apps? You can also perform multi-selection in the left panel to select multiple categories.
- Started roll out of new templates for Cloud Discovery that are based on popular searches such as "non-compliant cloud storage app". These basic filters can be used as templates to perform analysis on your discovered apps.
- For ease of use, you can now do actions such as sanction and unsanction across multiple apps in one action.
- We're now rolling out the ability to create custom discovery reports based on Azure Active Directory user groups. For example, if you want to see the cloud use of your marketing department, you can import the marketing group using the import user group feature, then create a custom report for this group.

**New features:**

- RBAC for Security Readers completed roll out. This feature enables you to manage the permissions you grant to your admins inside the Cloud App Security console. By default, all Azure Active Directory admins, Office 365 Global admins, and Security admins have full permissions in the portal.

Additionally, the File Alert page has been improved to now include a separate tab for History of the specific file. The improvement enables you to drill down into the violation history across all policies for the specific file. Every History event includes a snapshot of the file at the time of the alert. It will include an indication of whether the file was deleted or quarantined.
- [Admin quarantine](use-case-admin-quarantine.md) is now available in private preview for Office 365 SharePoint and OneDrive for Business files. This feature enables you to quarantine files that match policies or set an automated action to quarantine them. Quarantining removes the files from the user's SharePoint directory and copies the originals to the admin quarantine location you choose.

**Cloud Discovery improvements:**

- Cloud Discovery support for Cisco Meraki logs has been improved.
- The option to suggest an improvement to Cloud Discovery now enables you to suggest new risk factor.
- The custom log parser was improved to support log formats by separating the setting of time and date and to give you the option to set timestamp.

- New activities were added for Exchange to enable you to monitor which permissions were granted for user mailboxes or mailbox folders. These activities include:
  - Add recipient permissions
  - Remove recipient permissions
  - Add mailbox folder permissions
  - Remove mailbox folder permissions
  - Set mailbox folder permissions

   For example, you can now monitor users who were granted **SendAs** permissions to other users' mailboxes and as a result can now send emails in their name.

### Cloud App Security release 95

Released April 24, 2017

**Updates:**

- The **Accounts** page has been updated with improvements that make detecting risks easier. You can now more easily filter for internal and external accounts. See at a glance whether a user has admin permissions. You can perform actions on each account per-app such as remove permissions, remove user's collaborations, suspend user. Additionally, imported [user groups](user-groups.md) for each account will be displayed.

- For Microsoft work accounts (Office 365 and Azure Active Directory), Cloud App Security groups different user identifiers such as proxy addresses, aliases, SID, and more under a single account. All aliases related to an account will appear under the primary email address. Based on the list of user identifiers, for activities whose actor is a user identifier, the actor will be displayed as the primary user name UPN (User Principal Name). Based on the UPN, groups will be assigned and policies applied. This change will improve investigation of activities and fuse all related activities to the same session for anomalies and group-based policies. This feature will be gradually rolled out over the next month.

- The Robot tag was added as a possible risk factor in the Browser Use built-in report. Now, in addition to browser use being tagged as outdated, you can see when browser use was performed by a robot.

### Cloud App Security release 94

Released April 2, 2017

**New features:**

- Cloud App Security is now integrated with Azure RMS. You can protect files in Office 365 OneDrive and Sharepoint Online with Microsoft Rights Management directly from the Cloud App Security portal. Protection can be accomplished from the **Files** page. For more information, see [Integrating with Azure Information Protection](azip-integration.md). Support for additional applications will be available in future versions.
- Up until now, when robot and crawler activities take place on your network, it was especially hard to identify because the activities are not performed by a user on your network. Without your knowledge, bots and crawlers can run malicious tools on your computers. Now, Cloud App Security gives you the tools to see when robots and crawlers are performing activities on your network. You can use the new user agent tag to filter activities in the activity log. The user agent tag enables you to filter all activities performed by robots and you can use it to create a policy that alerts you each time this type of activity is detected. You'll be updated when future releases will include this risky activity as embedded into the anomaly detection alerts.
- The new unified app permissions page enables you to more easily investigate the permissions your users have given to third-party apps. By clicking on **Investigate** > **App permissions**, you can now view a list of all the permissions your users gave to third-party apps. A page of app permissions per connected app enables you to better compare between the various apps and the permissions granted. For more information, see [Manage app permissions](manage-app-permissions.md).
- You can filter data right from the table drawer for easier investigation.
In the **Activity log**, the **Files** table and **App permissions** pages are now enhanced with new contextual actions that makes pivoting in the investigation process a lot easier.

- **New Cloud Discovery Dashboard** - A brand new Cloud Discovery dashboard is available, designed to give you more insight into how cloud apps are being used in your organization. It provides an at-a-glance overview of what kinds of apps are being used, your open alerts and the risk levels of apps in your organization. It also lets you know who the top app users are in your organization and provides an App Headquarter location map. The new Dashboard has more options for filtering the data, to allow you to generate specific views, depending on what you're most interested in, and easy-to-understand graphics to give you the full picture at a glance.

- **New Cloud Discovery reports** - To view Cloud Discovery results, you can now generate two types of reports, Snapshot reports and Continuous reports. Snapshot reports provide ad-hoc visibility on a set of traffic logs you manually upload from your firewalls and proxies. Continuous reports show the results of all logs that are forwarded from your network using Cloud App Security's log collectors. These new reports provide improved visibility over all data, automatic identification of anomalous use as identified by the Cloud App Security machine learning anomaly detection engine, and identification of anomalous use as defined by you using the robust and granular policy engine. For more information, see [Set up Cloud Discovery](set-up-cloud-discovery.md).
