# Connect Google Cloud Platform to Microsoft Cloud App Security

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

This article provides instructions for connecting Microsoft Cloud App Security to your existing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account using the connector APIs. This connection gives you visibility into and control over GCP use. For information about how Cloud App Security protects GCP, see [Protect GCP](protect-gcp.md).

We recommend that you use a dedicated project for the integration and restrict access to the project to maintain stable integration and prevent deletions/modifications of the setup process. Also, if your GCP instance is part of a Google Workspace instance already connected to Cloud App Security, we recommend following the **For a GCP instance that is part of a connected Google Workspace organization** steps when you add the GCP connection details.

## Prerequisites

The integrating GCP user must have the following permissions:

- **IAM and Admin edit** – Organization level
- **Project creation and edit**

You can connect one or both of the following GCP to Cloud App Security connections:

- **Security auditing**: This connection gives you visibility into and control over GCP app use.
- **Security configuration**: This connection gives you fundamental security recommendations based on the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark for GCP.

Since you can add either or both of the connections, the steps in this article are written as independent instructions. If you have already added one of the connections, where relevant edit the existing configurations.

## How to connect GCP security auditing to Cloud App Security

Connecting GCP security auditing gives you visibility into and control over GCP app use.

### Configure Google Cloud Platform

> [!NOTE]
> The instructions for connecting your GCP environment for auditing follow [Google's recommendations](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/best-practices-for-working-with-google-cloud-audit-logging) for consuming aggregated logs. The integration leverages Google StackDriver and will consume additional resources that might impact your billing. The consumed resources are:
>
> - [Aggregated export sink – Organization level](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/aggregated_exports#concept)
> - [Pub/Sub topic – GCP project level](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/using_exported_logs#pubsub-overview)
> - [Pub/Sub subscription – GCP project level](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/using_exported_logs#pubsub-overview)
>
> The Cloud App Security auditing connection only imports Admin Activity audit logs; Data Access and System Event audit logs are not imported. For more information about GCP logs, see [Cloud Audit Logs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109230).
