# Connect AWS to Microsoft Cloud App Security

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

This article provides instructions for connecting your existing Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to Microsoft Cloud App Security using the connector APIs. For information about how Cloud App Security protects AWS, see [Protect AWS](protect-aws.md).

You can connect one or both of the following AWS to Cloud App Security connections:

- **Security auditing**: This connection gives you visibility into and control over AWS app use.
- **Security configuration**: This connection gives you fundamental security recommendations based on the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark for AWS.

Since you can add either or both of the connections, the steps in this article are written as independent instructions. If you've already added one of the connections, where relevant edit the existing configurations.

## How to connect AWS Security auditing to Cloud App Security

Use the following steps to configure your AWS auditing and then connect it to Cloud App Security.

### Step 1: Configure Amazon Web Services auditing

1. In your [Amazon Web Services console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), under **Security, Identity & Compliance**, select **IAM**.

1. Select **Users** and then select **Add user**.

    ![AWS users](media/aws-users.png "AWS users")

1. In the **Details** step, provide a new user name for Cloud App Security. Make sure that under **Access type** you select **Programmatic access** and select **Next Permissions**.<a name="set-permissions"></a>

            "cloudtrail:DescribeTrails",
            "cloudtrail:LookupEvents",
            "cloudtrail:GetTrailStatus",

            "cloudwatch:Get*",
            "cloudwatch:List*",
            "iam:List*",
            "iam:Get*",
            "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "s3:PutBucketAcl",
            "s3:GetBucketAcl",
            "s3:GetBucketLocation"
          ],
          "Effect" : "Allow",
          "Resource" : "*"
        }
      ]
     }
    ```

1. Back in the **Add user** screen, refresh the list if necessary, and select the user you created, and select **Next: Tags**.

    ![Attach existing policy in AWS](media/aws-attach-policy.png "Attach existing policy in AWS")

1. Select **Next: Review**.

1. If all the details are correct, select **Create user**.

    ![User permissions in AWS](media/aws-user-permissions.png "Review user permissions in AWS")

1. When you get the success message, select **Download .csv** to save a copy of the new user's credentials. You'll need these later.

    ![Download csv in AWS](media/aws-download-csv.png "Download csv in AWS")

    > [!NOTE]
    > After connecting AWS, you'll receive events for seven days prior to connection. If you just enabled CloudTrail, you'll receive events from the time you enabled CloudTrail.

### Step 2: Connect Amazon Web Services auditing to Cloud App Security

1. In the [Cloud App Security portal](https://portal.cloudappsecurity.com/), select **Investigate** and then **Connected apps**.

1. In the **App connectors** page, to provide the AWS connector credentials, do one of the following:

    **For a new connector**

    1. Select the plus sign (**+**) followed by **Amazon Web Services**.

        ![connect AWS auditing](media/connect-aws.png "connect AWS")

    1. In the pop-up, provide a name for the connector, and then select **Connect Amazon Web Services**.

        ![AWS auditing connector name](media/connect-aws-name.png)

    1. On the Connect Amazon Web services page, select **Security auditing**, paste the **Access key** and **Secret key** from the .csv file into the relevant fields, and select **Connect**.

        ![Connect AWS app security auditing for new connector](media/aws-connect-app-audit.png "Connect AWS app security auditing")

    **For an existing connector**

    1. In the list of connectors, on the row in which the AWS connector appears, select **Connect security auditing**.

        ![Screenshot of the Connected Apps page, showing edit Security Auditing link](media/aws-connect-app-edit-audit.png)
