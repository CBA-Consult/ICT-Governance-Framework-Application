## Configure Cloud App Security

1. In the [Cloud App Security portal](https://portal.cloudappsecurity.com/), click **Investigate** and then **Connected apps**.

1. To provide the Google Workspace connection details, under **App connectors**, do one of the following:

    **For a Google Workspace organization that already has a connected GCP instance**

    - In the list of connectors, at the end of row in which the GCP instance appears, click the three dots and then click **Add Google Workspace**.

    **For a Google Workspace organization that does not already have a connected GCP instance**

    - In the **Connected apps** page, click the plus sign (**+**) and select **Google Workspace**.

1. In the pop-up, fill in the following information:

    ![Google Workspace Configuration in Cloud App Security](media/connect-google-workspace/cas-config-google-workspace.png "Google Workspace Configuration in Cloud App Security")

    1. Enter the **Service account ID**, the **Email** that you copied earlier.

    1. Enter the **Project number (App ID)** that you copied earlier.

    1. Upload the P12 **Certificate** file that you saved earlier.

    1. Enter one **admin account email** of your Google Workspace admin.

    1. If you have a Google Workspace Business or Enterprise account, check this check box. For information about which features are available in Cloud App Security for Google Workspace Business or Enterprise, see [Enable instant visibility, protection, and governance actions for your apps](enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps.md).

    1. Click **Save settings**.

    1. **Follow the link** to connect to Google Workspace. This opens Google Workspace and you're asked to authorize access for Cloud App Security.

    1. Make sure the connection succeeded by clicking **Test now**.  
    Testing may take a couple of minutes.  
    After receiving a success notice, click **Done** and close the Google Workspace page.

After connecting Google Workspace, you'll receive events for 60 days prior to connection.

After connecting Google Workspace, Cloud App Security performs a full scan. Depending on how many files and users you have, completing the full scan can take awhile. To enable near real-time scanning, files on which activity is detected are moved to the beginning of the scan queue. For example, a file that is edited, updated, or shared is scanned right away. This doesn't apply to files that aren't inherently modified. For example, files that are viewed, previewed, printed, or exported are scanned during the regular scan.

If you have any problems connecting the app, see [Troubleshooting App Connectors](troubleshooting-api-connectors-using-error-messages.md).
