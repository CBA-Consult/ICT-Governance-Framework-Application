# Governing connected apps

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

Governance enables you to control what your users do, in real time, across apps. For connected apps, you can apply governance actions to files or activities. Governance actions are integrated actions you can run on files or activities directly from Microsoft Cloud App Security. Governance actions control what your users do, in real time, across connected apps. For information about where you can use governance actions, see [Apply governance actions](control.md#apply-governance-actions).

> [!NOTE]
> When Microsoft Cloud App Security attempts to run a governance action on a file but fails because the file is locked, it will automatically retry the governance action.

## File governance actions

The following governance actions can be taken for connected apps either on a specific file, user or from a specific policy.

- **Notifications:**

  - **Alerts** – Alerts can be triggered in the system and propagated via email and text message, based on severity level.

  - **User email notification** – Email messages can be customized and will be sent to all violating file owners.

  - **Notify specific users** – Specific list of email addresses that will receive these notifications.

  - **Notify last file editor** – Send notifications to the last person who modified the file.

- **Governance actions in apps** - Granular actions can be enforced per app, specific actions vary depending on app terminology.

  - **Labeling**
    - **Apply label** - Ability to add an Azure Information Protection classification label.
    - **Remove label** - Ability to remove an Azure Information Protection classification label.
  - **Change sharing**

    - **Remove public sharing** – Allow access only to named collaborators, for example: *Remove public access* for Google Workspace, and *Remove direct shared link* for Box and Dropbox.

    - **Remove external users** – Allow access only to company users.

    - **Make private** – Only Site Admins can access the file, all shares are removed.

    - **Remove a collaborator** – Remove a specific collaborator from the file.

    - **Reduce public access** - Set Publicly available files to be available only with a shared link. (Google)

    - **Expire shared link** - Ability to set an expiration date for a shared link after which it will no longer be active. (Box)

    - **Change sharing link access level** - Ability to change the access level of the shared link between company only, collaborators only, and public. (Box)

  - **Quarantine**

    - **Put in user quarantine** – Allow self-service by moving the file to a user-controlled quarantine folder

    - **Put in admin quarantine** – File is moved to quarantine in the admin drive, and the admin has to approve it.

  - **Inherit permissions from parent** - This governance action enables you to remove specific permissions set for a file or folder in Office 365. Then revert to whatever permissions are set for the parent folder.

  - **Trash** – Move the file to the trash folder. (Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, SharePoint)

## Activity governance actions

- **Notifications**

  - **Alerts** – Alerts can be triggered in the system and propagated via email and text message, based on severity level.

  - **User email notification** – Email messages can be customized and will be sent to all violating file owners.

  - **Notify additional users** – Specific list of email addresses that will receive these notifications.

- **Governance actions in apps** - Granular actions can be enforced per app, specific actions vary depending on app terminology.

  - **Suspend user** – Suspend the user from the application.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is set to automatically sync with the users in your Active Directory on-premises environment the settings in the on-premises environment will override the Azure AD settings and this governance action will be reverted.

  - **Require user to sign in again** – Signs the user out and requires them to sign in again.

  - **Confirm user compromised** - Set the user's risk level to high. This causes the relevant policy actions defined in Azure AD to be enforced. For more information How Azure AD works with risk levels, see [How does Azure AD use my risk feedback](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-risk-feedback#how-does-azure-ad-use-my-risk-feedback).

## Governance conflicts

After creating multiple policies, a situation may arise in which the governance actions in multiple policies overlap. In this case, Cloud App Security will process the governance actions as follows:

### Conflicts between policies

- If two policies contain actions that are contained on in each other (for example, **Remove external shares** is included in **Make private**), Cloud App Security will resolve the conflict and the stronger action will be enforced.
- If the actions are unrelated (for example, **Notify owner** and **Make private**). Both actions will take place.
- If the actions conflict (for example **Change owner to user A** and **Change owner to user B**), different results may result from every match. It's important to change your policies to prevent conflicts because they may result in unwanted changes in the drive that will be hard to detect.

### Conflicts in user sync

- If your Azure AD is set to automatically sync with the users in your Active Directory on-premises environment, the settings in the on-premises environment will override the Azure AD settings and this governance action will be reverted.

## Governance log

The Governance log provides a status record of each task that you set Cloud App Security to run, including both manual and automatic tasks. These tasks include those you set in policies, governance actions that you set on files and users, and any other action you set Cloud App Security to take. The Governance log also provides information about the success or failure of these actions. You can choose to retry or revert some of the governance actions from the Governance log.

To view the governance log, in the menu bar, click the settings cog ![settings icon](media/settings-icon.png "settings icon") and then select **Governance log**.

The following table is the full list of actions the Cloud App Security portal enables you to take. These actions are enabled in various places throughout the console as described in the **Location** column. Each governance action taken is listed in the Governance Log.
For information about how governance actions are treated when there are policy conflicts, see [Policy Conflicts](control-cloud-apps-with-policies.md).

| Location | Target object type | Governance action |Description| Related connectors|
