# Onboard and deploy Conditional Access App Control for any app

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

Session controls in Microsoft Cloud App Security can be configured to work with any web apps. This article describes how to onboard and deploy custom line-of-business apps, non-featured SaaS apps, and on-premise apps hosted via the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Application Proxy with session controls.

For a list of apps that are featured by Cloud App Security to work out-of-the-box, see [Protect apps with Cloud App Security Conditional Access App Control](proxy-intro-aad.md#featured-apps).

## Prerequisites

- Your organization must have the following licenses to use Conditional Access App Control:

  - [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Premium P1](/azure/active-directory/license-users-groups) or higher, or the license required by your identity provider (IdP) solution
  - Microsoft Cloud App Security

- Apps must be configured with single sign-on
- Apps must use one of the following authentication protocols:

    |IdP|Protocols|
    |---|---|
    |Azure AD|SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect|
    |Other|SAML 2.0|

## To deploy any app

Follow these steps to configure any app to be controlled by Cloud App Security Conditional Access App Control.

**Step 1: [Configure your IdP to work with Cloud App Security](#conf-idp)**

**Step 2: [Configure the users that will deploy the app](#conf-users)**

**Step 3: [Configure the app that you are deploying](#conf-app)**

**Step 4: [Verify that the app is working correctly](#verify-app)**

**Step 5: [Enable the app for use in your organization](#enable-app)**

**Step 6: [Update the Azure AD policy](#update-azure-ad)**

> [!NOTE]
> To deploy Conditional Access App Control for Azure AD apps, you need a valid [license for Azure Active Directory Premium P1 or higher](/azure/active-directory/license-users-groups) as well as a Cloud App Security license.

## Step 1:  Configure your IdP to work with Cloud App Security<a name="conf-idp"></a><a name="conf-azure-ad"></a>

### Configure integration with Azure AD

>[!NOTE]
>When configuring an application with SSO in Azure AD, or other identity providers, one field that may be listed as optional is the sign-on URL setting. Note that this field may be required for Conditional Access App Control to work.

Use the following steps to create an Azure AD Conditional Access policy that routes app sessions to Cloud App Security. For other IdP solutions, see [Configure integration with other IdP solutions](#configure-integration-with-other-idp-solutions).

1. In Azure AD, browse to **Security** > **Conditional Access**.

1. On the **Conditional Access** pane, in the toolbar at the top, click **New policy**.

1. On the **New** pane, in the **Name** textbox, enter the policy name.

1. Under **Assignments**, click **Users and groups**, assign the users that will be onboarding (initial sign on and verification) the app, and then click **Done**.

1. Under **Assignments**, click **Cloud apps**, assign the apps you want to control with Conditional Access App Control, and then click **Done**.

1. Under **Access controls**, click **Session**, select **Use Conditional Access App Control** and choose a built-in policy (**Monitor only** or **Block downloads**) or **Use custom policy** to set an advanced policy in Cloud App Security, and then click **Select**.

1. Optionally, add conditions and grant controls as required.

1. Set **Enable policy** to **On** and then click **Create**.

### Configure integration with other IdP solutions

Use the following steps to route app sessions from other IdP solutions to Cloud App Security. For Azure AD, see [Configure integration with Azure AD](#configure-integration-with-azure-ad).

> [!NOTE]
> For examples of how to configure IdP solutions, see:
>
> - [Configure your PingOne IdP](proxy-idp-pingone.md)
> - [Configure your AD FS IdP](proxy-idp-adfs.md)
> - [Configure your Okta IdP](proxy-idp-okta.md)

1. In Cloud App Security, browse to **Investigate** > **Connected apps** > **Conditional Access App Control apps**.

1. Click the plus sign (**+**), and in the pop-up, select the app you want to deploy, and then click **Start Wizard**.
1. On the **APP INFORMATION** page, fill out the form using the information from your app's single sign-on configuration page, and then click **Next**.
    - If your IdP provides a single sign-on metadata file for the selected app, select **Upload metadata file from the app** and upload the metadata file.
    - Or, select **Fill in data manually** and provide the following information:
        - **Assertion consumer service URL**
        - If your app provides a SAML certificate, select **Use <app_name> SAML certificate** and upload the certificate file.

    ![Screenshot showing app information page](media/proxy-deploy-add-idp-app-info.png)

1. On the **IDENTITY PROVIDER** page, use the provided steps to set up a new application in your IdP's portal, and then click **Next**.
    1. Go to your IdP's portal and create a new custom SAML app.
    1. Copy the single sign-on configuration of the existing `<app_name>` app to the new custom app.
    1. Assign users to the new custom app.
    1. Copy the apps single sign-on configuration information, you'll need it in the next step.

    ![Screenshot showing gather identity provider information page](media/proxy-deploy-add-idp-get-conf.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > These steps may differ slightly depending on your identity provider. This step is recommended for the following reasons:
    >
    > - Some identity providers do not allow you to change the SAML attributes or URL properties of a gallery app
    > - Configuring a custom app enables you to test this application with access and session controls without changing the existing behavior for your organization.

1. On the next page, fill out the form using the information from your app's single sign-on configuration page, and then click **Next**.
    - If your IdP provides a single sign-on metadata file for the selected app, select **Upload metadata file from the app** and upload the metadata file.
    - Or, select **Fill in data manually** and provide the following information:
        - **Assertion consumer service URL**
        - If your app provides a SAML certificate, select **Use <app_name> SAML certificate** and upload the certificate file.

    ![Screenshot showing enter identity provider information page](media/proxy-deploy-add-idp-enter-conf.png)

1. On the next page, copy the following information, and then click **Next**. You'll need the information in the next step.

    - Single sign-on URL
    - Attributes and values

    ![Screenshot showing gather identity providers SAML information page](media/proxy-deploy-add-idp-ext-conf.png)

1. In your IdP's portal, do the following:
    > [!NOTE]
    > The settings are commonly found in IdP portal's custom app settings page

    1. [Recommended] Create a backup of your current settings.
    1. Replace the single sign-on URL field value with the Cloud App Security SAML single sign-on URL you noted earlier.
        > [!NOTE]
        > Some providers may refer to the single sign-on URL as the *Reply URL*.
    1. Add the attributes and values you made a note of earlier to the app's properties.
        > [!NOTE]
        >
        > - Some providers may refer to them as *User attributes* or *Claims*.
        > - When creating a new SAML app, the Okta Identity Provider limits attributes to 1024 characters. To mitigate this limitation, first create the app without the relevant attributes. After creating the app, edit it, and then add the relevant attributes.

    1. Verify that the name identifier is in the email address format.
    1. Save your settings.
1. On the **APP CHANGES** page, do the following, and then click **Next**. You'll need the information in the next step.

    - Copy the Single sign-on URL
    - Download the Cloud App Security SAML certificate

    ![Screenshot showing gather Cloud App Security SAML information page](media/proxy-deploy-add-idp-app-changes.png)

1. In your app's portal, on the single sign-on settings, do the following:
    1. [Recommended] Create a backup of your current settings.
    1. In the single sign-on URL field, enter the Cloud App Security single sign-on URL you made a note of earlier.
    1. Upload the Cloud App Security SAML certificate you downloaded earlier.
    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - After saving your settings, all associated login requests to this app will be routed through Conditional Access App Control.
    > - The Cloud App Security SAML certificate is valid for one year. After it expires, a new certificate will need to be generated.

## Step 2: Configure the users that will deploy the app<a name="conf-users"></a>

    ![Screenshot of settings for App onboarding and maintenance.](media/app-onboarding-settings.png)

## Step 3: Configure the app that you are deploying<a name="conf-app"></a>

Go to the app that you are deploying. The page you see depends on whether the app is recognized. Do one of the following:

| App status | Description | Steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Not recognized | You will see an app not recognized page prompting you to configure your app. | 1. [Add the app to Conditional Access App Control](#add-app).<br /> 2. [Add the domains for the app](#add-domains), and then return to the app and refresh the page.<br /> 3. [Install the certificates for the app](#install-certs). |
| Recognized | You will see an onboarding page prompting you to continue the app configuration process. | - [Install the certificates for the app](#install-certs). <br /><br /> **Note:** Make sure the app is configured with all domains required for the app to function correctly. To configure additional domains, proceed to [Add the domains for the app](#add-domains), and then return to the app page. |

### To add a new app<a name="add-app"></a>

1. In the menu bar, click the settings cog ![settings icon](media/settings-icon.png "settings icon"), and then select **Conditional Access App Control**.

1. In the banner, click **View new apps**.

    ![Conditional access app control view new apps](media/caac-view-apps.png)

1. In the list of new apps, for each app that you are onboarding, click on the **+** sign, and then click **Add**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If an app does not appear in the Cloud App Security app catalog, it will appear in the dialog under unidentified apps along with the login URL. When you click the + sign for these apps, you can onboard the application as a custom app.

    ![Conditional access app control discovered Azure AD apps](media/caac-discovered-aad-apps.png)

### To add domains for an app<a name="add-domains"></a>

Associating the correct domains to an app allows Cloud App Security to enforce policies and audit activities.

For example, if you have configured a policy that blocks downloading files for an associated domain, file downloads by the app from that domain will be blocked. However, file downloads by the app from domains not associated with the app will not be blocked and the action will not be audited in the activity log.
> [!NOTE]
> Cloud App Security still adds a suffix to domains not associated with the app to ensure a seamless user experience.

1. From within the app, on the Cloud App Security admin toolbar, click **Discovered domains**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The admin toolbar is only visible to users with permissions to onboard or maintenance apps.
1. In the Discovered domains panel, make a note of domain names or export the list as a .csv file.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The panel displays a list of discovered domains that are not associated in the app. The domain names are fully qualified.
1. Go to Cloud App Security, in the menu bar, click the settings cog ![settings icon](media/settings-icon.png "settings icon") and select **Conditional Access App Control**.
1. In the list of apps, on the row in which the app you are deploying appears, choose the three dots at the end of the row, and then under **APP DETAILS**, choose **Edit**.
    > [!TIP]
    > To view the list of domains configured in the app, click **View app domains**.
1. In **User-defined domains**, enter all the domains you want to associate with this app, and then click **Save**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can use the * wildcard character as a placeholder for any character. When adding domains, decide whether you want to add specific domains (`sub1.contoso.com`,`sub2.contoso.com`) or multiple domains (`*.contoso.com`).

### To install root certificates<a name="install-certs"></a>

1. Repeat the following steps to install the **Current CA** and **Next CA** self-signed root certificates.
    1. Select the certificate.
