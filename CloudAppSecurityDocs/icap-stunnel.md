# External DLP integration

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Cloud App Security can integrate with existing DLP solutions to extend these controls to the cloud while preserving a consistent and unified policy across on-premises and cloud activities. The platform exports easy-to-use interfaces including REST API and ICAP, enabling integration with content classification systems such as Symantec Data Loss Prevention (formerly Vontu Data Loss Prevention) or Forcepoint DLP.

Integration is accomplished by using the standard ICAP protocol, an http-like protocol described in [RFC 3507](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3507). To secure ICAP for transmission of your data, it's required to set up a secure TLS tunnel (stunnel) between your DLP solution and Cloud App Security. The stunnel setup provides TLS encryption functionality to your data as it travels between your DLP server and Cloud App Security.

This guide provides the steps necessary for configuring the ICAP connection in Cloud App Security and the stunnel setup to secure communication through it.

## Architecture

Cloud App Security scans your cloud environment and based on your file policy configuration, decides whether to scan the file using the internal DLP engine or the external DLP. If external DLP scan is applied, the file is sent over the secure tunnel to the customer environment where it's relayed to the ICAP appliance for the DLP verdict: allowed/blocked. Responses are sent back to Cloud App Security over the stunnel where it's used by the policy to determine subsequent actions such as notifications, quarantine, and sharing control.

![Stunnel architecture](media/icap-architecture-stunnel.png)

Since Cloud App Security runs in Azure, a deployment in Azure yields improved performance. However, other options including other Clouds and On-Premises deployment are supported. Deploying in other environments may result in degraded performance due to higher latency and lower throughput. The ICAP server and stunnel must be deployed together on the same network to make sure the traffic is encrypted.

## Prerequisites

In order for Cloud App Security to send data through your stunnel to your ICAP server, open your DMZ firewall to the external IP addresses used by Cloud App Security with a dynamic source port number.

1. Source addresses: Refer to [Connect apps, under Prerequisites](enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps.md#prerequisites)
2. Source TCP port: Dynamic
3. Destination address(es): one or two IP address of the stunnel connected to the external ICAP server that you'll configure in the next steps
4. Destination TCP port: As defined in your network

> [!NOTE]
> By default the stunnel port number is set to 11344. You can change it to another port if necessary, but be sure to make note of the new port number - you will be required to enter it in the next step.

## STEP 1:  Set up ICAP server

Set up an ICAP server, taking note of the port number, and make sure that you set **Mode** to **Blocking**. Blocking mode sets the ICAP server to relay the classification verdict back to Cloud App Security.

Refer to your External DLP product documentation for instructions on how to accomplish this setup. As an example, see [Appendix A: Forcepoint ICAP server setup](#forcepoint) and [Appendix B: Symantec Deployment Guide](#symantec).

## STEP 2:  Set up your stunnel server

In this step, you set up the stunnel connected to your ICAP server.

>[!NOTE]
> While highly recommended, this step is optional and can be skipped on test workloads.

### Install stunnel on a server

**Prerequisites**

- **A server** - either a Windows Server or a Linux server based on a major distribution.

Refer to the [stunnel website](https://www.stunnel.org/index.html) for details about the types of servers that support stunnel installation. If you're using Linux, you can use your Linux distribution manager to install it.

#### Install stunnel on Windows

1. [Download the latest Windows Server installation](https://www.stunnel.org/downloads.html) (This application should work on any recent Windows Server edition). (default installation)

2. During installation, don't create a new self-signed certificate. You'll create a certificate in a later step.

3. Click **Start server after installation**.

4. Create a certificate in one of the following ways:

    - Use your certificate management server to create an TLS certificate on your ICAP server. Then copy the keys to the server you prepared for the stunnel installation.
    - Or, on the stunnel server, use the following OpenSSL commands to generate a private key and a self-signed certificate. Replace these variables:
        - **key.pem** with the name of your private key
        - **cert.pem** with the name of your certificate
        - **stunnel-key** with the name of the newly created key

5. Under your stunnel installation path, open the config directory. By default it is:
        c:\Program Files (x86)\stunnel\config\
6. Run the command line with admin permissions:

    ```bash
    ..\bin\openssl.exe genrsa -out key.pem 2048
    ..\bin\openssl.exe  req -new -x509 -config ".\openssl.cnf" -key key.pem -out .\cert.pem -days 1095
    ```

7. Concatenate the cert.pem and key.pem and save them to the file: `type cert.pem key.pem >> stunnel-key.pem`

8. [Download the public key](https://adaprodconsole.blob.core.windows.net/icap/publicCert.pem) and save it in this location **C:\Program Files (x86)\stunnel\config\MCASca.pem**.

9. Add the following rules to open the port in the Windows firewall:

    ```console
    rem Open TCP Port 11344 inbound and outbound
    netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Secure ICAP TCP Port 11344" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=11344
    netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Secure ICAP TCP Port 11344" dir=out action=allow protocol=TCP localport=11344
    ```

10. Run: `c:\Program Files (x86)\stunnel\bin\stunnel.exe` to open the stunnel application.

11. Click **Configuration** and then **Edit configuration**.

    ![Edit Windows Server configuration](media/stunnel-windows.png)

12. Open the file and paste the following server configuration lines. The **DLP Server IP** is the IP address of your ICAP server, **stunnel-key** is the key that you created in the previous step, and **MCASCAfile** is the public certificate of the Cloud App Security stunnel client. Delete any example text that is in place (in the example it displays Gmail text) and copy the following text into the file:

    ```ini
    [microsoft-Cloud App Security]
    accept = 0.0.0.0:11344
    connect = **ICAP Server IP**:1344
    cert = C:\Program Files (x86)\stunnel\config\**stunnel-key**.pem
    CAfile = C:\Program Files (x86)\stunnel\config\**MCASCAfile**.pem
    TIMEOUTclose = 0
    client = no
    ```

13. Save the file and then click **Reload configuration**.

14. To validate that everything is running as expected, from a command prompt, run:
    `netstat -nao  | findstr 11344`

#### Install stunnel on Ubuntu

The following example is based on an Ubuntu server installation, when signed in as root user - for other servers use parallel commands.

On the prepared server, download and install the latest version of stunnel. Run the following command on your Ubuntu server to install both stunnel and OpenSSL:

```console
apt-get update
apt-get install openssl -y
apt-get install stunnel4 -y
```

Verify that stunnel is installed by running the following command from a console. You should get the version number and a list of configuration options:

stunnel-version

### Generate certificates

The ICAP server and Cloud App Security use a private key and public certificate for server encryption and authentication across the stunnel.
Make sure you create the private key without a pass phrase so that stunnel can run as a background service. Also, set the permission on the files to **readable** for the stunnel owner and to **none** for everyone else.

You can create the certificates in one of the following ways:

- Use your certificate management server to create an TLS certificate on your ICAP server. Then copy the keys to the server you prepared for the stunnel installation.
- Or, on the stunnel server, use the following OpenSSL commands to generate a private key and a self-signed certificate.
Replace these variables:
  - **key.pem** with the name of your private key
  - **cert.pem** with the name of your certificate
  - **stunnel-key** with the name of the newly created key

    ``` console
    openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
    openssl req -new -x509 -key key.pem -out cert.pem -days 1095
    cat key.pem cert.pem >> /etc/ssl/private/stunnel-key.pem
    ```

### Download the Cloud App Security stunnel client public key

Download the public key from this location: https://adaprodconsole.blob.core.windows.net/icap/publicCert.pem
and save it in this location:
**/etc/ssl/certs/MCASCAfile.pem**

### Configure stunnel

The stunnel configuration is set in the stunnel.conf file.

1. Create the stunnel.conf file in the following directory: **vim /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf**

2. Open the file and paste the following server configuration lines.  The **DLP Server IP** is the IP address of your ICAP server, **stunnel-key** is the key that you created in the previous step, and **MCASCAfile** is the public certificate of the Cloud App Security stunnel client:

    ```ini
    [microsoft-Cloud App Security]
    accept = 0.0.0.0:11344
    connect = **ICAP Server IP**:1344
    cert = /etc/ssl/private/**stunnel-key**.pem
    CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/**MCASCAfile**.pem
    TIMEOUTclose = 1
    client = no
    ```

### Update your IP table

Update your IP address table with the following route rule:

```bash
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 11344 -j ACCEPT
```

To make the update to your IP table persistent, use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent
sudo /sbin/iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

### Run stunnel

1. On your stunnel server, run the following command:

    ```bash
    vim /etc/default/stunnel4
    ```

2. Change the variable ENABLED to 1:

    ```bash
    ENABLED=1
    ```

3. Restart the service for the configuration to take effect:

    ```bash
    /etc/init.d/stunnel4 restart
    ```

4. Run the following commands to verify that the stunnel is running properly:

    ```bash
    ps -A | grep stunnel
    ```

    and that it's listening on the port listed:

    ```bash
    netstat -anp | grep 11344
    ```

5. Make sure that the network in which the stunnel server was deployed matches the network prerequisites as mentioned earlier. This is required to allow incoming connections from Cloud App Security to successfully reach the server.

If the process is still not running, refer to the [stunnel documentation](https://www.stunnel.org/docs.html) to troubleshoot.

## STEP 3:  Connect to Cloud App Security

1. In Cloud App Security, under **Settings** select **Security extensions** and select the **External DLP** tab.

2. Click on the plus to add a new connection.

3. In the **Add  new external DLP** wizard, provide a **Connection name** (for example My Forcepoint connector) that will be used to identify the connector.

4. Select the **Connection type**:
    - **Symantec Vontu** – Use the customized integration for Vontu DLP appliances.
    - **Forcepoint DLP** – Use the customized integration for Forcepoint DLP appliances.
    - **Generic ICAP – REQMOD** - Use other DLP appliances that use [Request Modification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3507).
    - **Generic ICAP – RESPMOD** - Use other DLP appliances that use [Response Modification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3507).

        ![Cloud App Security ICAP connection type](media/icap-wizard1.png)

5. Browse to select the public certificate you generated in the previous steps, "cert.pem", to connect to your stunnel. Click **Next**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > It is highly recommended to check the **Use secure ICAP** box to set up an encrypted stunnel gateway. If, for testing purposes or if you don't have an stunnel server, you can uncheck this box to integrate directly with your DLP server.

6. In the **Server configuration** screen, provide the **IP address** and **Port** of the stunnel server that you set up in Step 2. For load-balancing purposes, you can configure the **IP address** and **Port** of an additional server. The provided IP addresses should be the external static IP addresses of your servers.

    ![Cloud App Security ICAP connection IP address and port](media/icap-wizard2.png)

7. Click **Next**. Cloud App Security tests connectivity to the server you configured. If you receive an error, review the instructions and network settings. After it's successfully connected, you can click **Quit**.

8. Now, to direct traffic to this external DLP server, when you create a **File policy** under **Content inspection method**, select the connection you created. Read more about [creating a File policy](data-protection-policies.md).

## Appendix A: ForcePoint ICAP server setup <a name="forcepoint"></a>

In ForcePoint, set your appliance using the following steps:

1. In your DLP appliance, go to **Deployment** > **System Modules**.

    ![ICAP deployment](media/icap-system-modules.png)

2. In the **General** tab, make sure **ICAP Server** is **Enabled** and the default **Port** is set to **1344**. Also, under **Allow connection to this ICAP Server from the following IP addresses**, select **Any IP address**.

    ![ICAP configuration](media/icap-ip-address.png)

3. In the HTTP/HTTPS tab, make sure to set **Mode** to **Blocking**.

    ![ICAP blocking](media/icap-blocking.png)

## Appendix B: Symantec Deployment Guide <a name="symantec"></a>

The supported Symantec DLP versions are 11 and higher.

As noted above, you should deploy a detection server in the same Azure datacenter where your Cloud App Security tenant resides. The detection server syncs with the enforce server through a dedicated IPSec tunnel.

### Detection server installation

The detection server used by Cloud App Security is a standard Network Prevent for Web server. There are several configuration options that should be changed:

1. Disable **Trial Mode**:
    1. Under **System** > **Servers and Detectors**, click on the ICAP target.

        ![ICAP target](media/icap-target.png)

    1. Click **Configure**.

        ![Configure ICAP target](media/configure-icap-target.png)

    1. Disable **Trial Mode**.

        ![disable trial mode pop-up](media/icap-disable-trial-mode.png)

2. Under **ICAP** > **Response Filtering**, change the **Ignore Responses Smaller Than** value to 1.

3. And add "application/\*" to the list of **Inspect Content Type</em>**.

    ![inspect content type](media/icap-inspect-content-type.png)

4. Click **Save**

### Policy configuration

Cloud App Security seamlessly supports all detection rule types included with Symantec DLP, so there's no need to alter existing rules. However, there's a configuration change that must be applied to all existing and new policies to enable full integration. This change is the addition of a specific response rule to all policies.

Add the configuration change to your Vontu:

1. Go to **Manage** > **Policies** > **Response Rules** and click **Add Response Rule**.

    ![add response rule](media/icap-add-response-rule.png)

2. Make sure **Automated Response** is selected and click **Next**.

    ![automated response](media/icap-automated-response.png)

3. Type a rule name, for example, **Block HTTP/HTTPS**. Under **Actions**, select **Block HTTP/HTTPS** and click **Save**.

    ![block http](media/icap-block-http.png)

Add the rule you created to any existing policies:

1. In each Policy, switch to the **Response** tab.

2. From the **Response rule** drop-down, select the block response rule you created earlier.

3. Save the policy.

    ![disable trial mode in policy](media/icap-add-policy.png)

This rule must be added to all existing policies.
