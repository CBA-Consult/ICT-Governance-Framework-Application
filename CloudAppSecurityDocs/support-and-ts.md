[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

This article describes the available support and troubleshooting options for Cloud App Security.

## Manage support requests for Cloud App Security

Microsoft provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support for Microsoft Cloud App Security. Support is available both online and by phone for paid and trial subscriptions. Online technical support is available in English and Japanese. Phone support and online billing support are available
in additional languages.

As an admin, you can use the **Help + Support** option to file an online support request for Cloud App Security from the Azure portal. To create a support request, your account must be assigned one of the following [administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal):

* Global administrator

* Service administrator

Select **support request** to create a new support request that opens to the **Basics** tab of the Azure *Help + support* page by following the protocol below.

> For technical support with third-party products that work with Microsoft Cloud App Security (for example, Box, Salesforce, and Google Workspace) contact the supplier of that product first.

### Create an online support request
