# Email notification preferences

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about how to personalize the email notifications sent by Cloud App Security to your users when a breach is detected.

> [!NOTE]
> This customization only affects the notifications sent to your end users, not the notifications sent to Cloud App Security administrators.

## <a name="mailsettings"></a> Set email notification preferences

 Microsoft Cloud App Security enables you to customize the email notifications sent to end users involved in breaches. To set parameters for email notifications, follow this procedure. For information about the Microsoft Cloud App Security email server IP address that you should allow in your anti-spam service, see [Network requirements](network-requirements.md).

1. In the menu bar, click the settings cog, select **Settings**, and then select the **Mail settings** tab.

2. Under **Email sender identity**: If you're planning to use the default email settings, you don't need to change anything in this section. If you want to customize the email sender identity, you can set any of the settings here to customize the field you want to change. You can change any or all of the following items: **From display name**, **From email address**, **Reply-to email address**. Microsoft Cloud App Security accomplishes the customization by using a third-party mail service called MailChimp&reg;. Make sure you review and accept MailChimp's Terms of Service and Privacy Statement to enable customization. Otherwise, Microsoft Cloud App Security will send the notifications using the default settings.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Only unicode characters are supported in the display name and the email address according to the [rfc822 standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc822.txt).

3. For the **Email design**, you can use an html file to customize and design the email messages sent from the system. The html file used for your template should include the following things:

    - All template CSS files should be inline in the template.

    - The template should have three uneditable placeholders:

        - **%%logo%%** - URL to your company's logo that was uploaded in the General setting page.

        - **%%title%%** - Placeholder for the title of the email, as set by the policy.

        - **%%content%%** - Placeholder for the content that will be included for end users, as set by the policy.

4. Click **Upload a template...** and select the file you created.

5. Click **Send a test email** to email yourself an example of the template you created. The email will be sent to the account you used to log into the portal. In the test email, you'll see and verify the following items:
    - The metadata fields
    - The template
    - The email subject
    - The title in the email body
    - The content

## Sample email template
