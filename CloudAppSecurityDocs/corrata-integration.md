# Integrate Cloud App Security with Corrata

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

If you work with both Cloud App Security and Corrata, you can integrate the two products to enhance your security Cloud Discovery experience for mobile app use. Corrata, as a local Mobile gateway, monitors your organization's traffic from mobile devices enabling you to set policies for blocking transactions. Together, Cloud App Security and Corrata provide the following capabilities:

- Seamless deployment of Cloud Discovery - Use Corrata to collect your mobile device traffic and send it to Cloud App Security. This eliminates the need for installation of log collectors on your network endpoints to enable Cloud Discovery.
- Corrata's block capabilities are automatically applied on apps you set as unsanctioned in Cloud App Security.
- Enhance your Corrata portal with Cloud App Security's risk assessment for leading cloud apps, which can be viewed directly in the Corrata portal.

- A valid license for Corrata Cloud
