# Govern discovered apps

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

After you've reviewed the list of discovered apps in your environment, you can secure your environment by approving safe apps (**Sanctioned**) or prohibiting unwanted apps (**Unsanctioned**) in the following ways.

## <a name="BKMK_SanctionApp"></a> Sanctioning/unsanctioning an app

You can unsanction a specific risky app by clicking the three dots at the end of the row. Then select **Unsanction**. Unsanctioning an app doesn't block use, but enables you to more easily monitor its use with the Cloud Discovery filters. You can then notify users of the unsanctioned app and suggest an alternative safe app for their use.

If you have a list of apps you want to sanction or unsanction, use the checkbox to select the apps you want to manage, then select the action.

To query a list of unsanctioned apps, you can [generate a block script using the Cloud App Security APIs](api-discovery-script.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If your tenant uses Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Zscaler NSS, or iboss, any app you mark as unsanctioned is automatically blocked by Cloud App Security, and the following sections regarding creating blocking scripts are unnecessary. For more information, see [Integrate with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](mde-integration.md), [Integrate with Zscaler](zscaler-integration.md), and [Integrate with iboss](iboss-integration.md) respectively.

## Export a block script to govern discovered apps

Cloud App Security enables you to block access to unsanctioned apps by using your existing on-prem security appliances. You can generate a dedicated block script and import it to your appliance. This solution doesn't require redirection of all of the organization's web traffic to a proxy.

1. In the Cloud Discovery dashboard, tag any apps you want to block as **Unsanctioned**.

2. In the title bar, click on the three dots and select **Generate block script...**.

3. In **Generate block script**, select the appliance you want to generate the block script for.

4. Then, click the Generate script button to create a block script for all your unsanctioned apps. By default, the file will be named with the date on which it was exported and the appliance type you selected. *2017-02-19_CAS_Fortigate_block_script.txt* would be an example file name

5. Import the file created to your appliance.
