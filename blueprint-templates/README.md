# ICT Governance Framework - Blueprint and Policy Templates

## Overview

This directory contains standardized templates for blueprints and policies that can be easily adapted to specific requirements as part of the CBA Consult IT Management Framework implementation.

## Task 3: Create Blueprint and Policy Templates

This addresses **Task 3** from the CBA Consult IT Management Framework smart tasks:
- Create templates for common blueprints, such as cloud infrastructure, security, and compliance
- Develop policy templates for areas like data privacy, access control, and incident response
- Ensure templates align with the target governance framework and industry best practices
