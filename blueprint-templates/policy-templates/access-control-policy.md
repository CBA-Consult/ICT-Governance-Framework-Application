## Purpose

This Access Control Policy establishes the framework for managing user access to information systems, applications, and data within the organization. The policy ensures that access rights are granted based on business need, principle of least privilege, and appropriate authorization levels while maintaining security and compliance requirements.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All employees, contractors, consultants, and third-party users
- All information systems, applications, and data repositories
- All access methods including physical, logical, and remote access
- All environments including production, testing, and development
- Cloud services, on-premises systems, and hybrid environments

## Policy Statement

The organization is committed to:
- Implementing robust access control mechanisms to protect information assets
- Ensuring access is granted based on legitimate business requirements
- Maintaining the principle of least privilege for all user access
- Regularly reviewing and updating access rights
- Monitoring and auditing access activities for compliance and security

## Regulatory Compliance

This policy supports compliance with:
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** - Article 32 (Security of processing)
- **ISO 27001:2013** - A.9 Access Control
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** - Protect (PR.AC)
- **SOC 2 Type II** - Common Criteria 6.1-6.8
- **PCI DSS** - Requirement 7 (Restrict access to cardholder data)

## Access Control Principles

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Users shall be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions
- Access rights shall be limited to specific systems, applications, and data required for business purposes
- Administrative privileges shall be granted only when absolutely necessary
- Temporary elevated access shall be time-limited and monitored

### 2. Need-to-Know Basis
- Access to sensitive information shall be granted only to users who require it for legitimate business purposes
- Data classification levels shall determine access requirements
- Compartmentalization of information shall be implemented where appropriate
- Cross-functional access shall require additional approval

### 3. Segregation of Duties
- Critical business processes shall be divided among multiple individuals
- No single individual shall have complete control over critical transactions
- Approval and execution functions shall be separated
- System administration and security monitoring shall be segregated

### 4. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of access controls shall be implemented
- Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) shall be enforced
- Network segmentation shall support access control objectives
- Monitoring and alerting shall detect unauthorized access attempts
