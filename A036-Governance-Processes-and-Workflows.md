├── Risk Management & Compliance
└── Innovation & Emerging Technology Evaluation

Execution Layer (Technology Stewards)
├── Change Management & Release Control
├── Operational Risk Management
└── Performance Monitoring & Reporting
```

### 1.2 Process Integration Model

All governance processes are integrated through:
