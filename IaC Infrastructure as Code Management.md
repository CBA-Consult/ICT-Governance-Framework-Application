**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools play a crucial role in automating the setup, configuration, and management of cloud infrastructure. Let's explore some popular IaC tools:

1. **Terraform**:
   - **Description**: Terraform uses declarative configuration files (written in HashiCorp Configuration Language) to define and provision infrastructure resources across various cloud providers.
   - **Usage**: Define resources (e.g., VMs, networks) in Terraform files, and Terraform handles provisioning.

2. **AWS CloudFormation**:
   - **Description**: AWS-specific tool for defining and provisioning AWS resources using JSON or YAML templates.
   - **Usage**: Create CloudFormation stacks to manage infrastructure.

3. **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**:
   - **Description**: Microsoft Azure's native IaC tool.
   - **Usage**: Define resources in ARM templates (JSON) for Azure deployments.
