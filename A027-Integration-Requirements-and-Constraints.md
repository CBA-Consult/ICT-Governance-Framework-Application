# A027 â€“ Integration Requirements and Constraints Analysis

**WBS:** 1.2.1.2.3  
**Context:** Follows A026; focuses on system interfaces and interoperability.

## 1. Summary
Analyze integration requirements, technical constraints, and interoperability considerations for the ICT Governance Framework Application.

## 2. Deliverables
- Integration Requirements Document
- Constraint Analysis Report
- Compatibility Assessment

## 3. Acceptance Criteria
- All integration requirements are clearly documented and approved.
- Constraints and compatibility issues are identified and analyzed.
- Recommendations for interface and interoperability are provided.

## 4. Integration Requirements
| ID   | Requirement Description                                      | Priority | Acceptance Criteria                |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| IR-1 | The system shall integrate with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps via REST API. | High | API connectivity and data sync tested. |
| IR-2 | The system shall support SSO integration with Azure AD.      | High     | SSO login works for all users.     |
| IR-3 | The system shall export reports to external BI tools (CSV, API). | Medium | Reports can be imported by BI tools. |
| IR-4 | The system shall provide a documented API for third-party integrations. | Medium | API documentation is published.    |

## 5. Constraint Analysis
- **API Rate Limits:** Defender for Cloud Apps API allows 30 requests/minute per tenant.
- **Authentication:** All integrations must use OAuth2 or API tokens.
- **Data Privacy:** Data exchanged must comply with GDPR and organizational policies.
- **Network:** Outbound connections must be allowed to Microsoft cloud endpoints.

## 6. Compatibility Assessment
- **Supported Protocols:** REST/HTTPS, OAuth2, SAML.
- **Data Formats:** JSON, CSV.
- **Versioning:** All integrated APIs must support versioning and backward compatibility.
- **Interoperability:** Interfaces must be tested with all target systems (e.g., Azure AD, BI tools).

## 7. Review & Approval
All requirements and constraints must be reviewed and approved by the architecture and security teams.
