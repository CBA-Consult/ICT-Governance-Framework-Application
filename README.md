# ICT-Governance-Framework-Application
The CBA Consult IT Management Framework is a project to optimize companies goverenance framework in a multi cloud environment. One of the reasons the framework and the procedures involved in creating, maintaining and updating the framework is leveraging the IT innovative solutions as in governance and maintaince framework updates and execution of blueprints, policies and ensure compliance to these requirements.

Introduction
The IT Governance framework has evolved drastically with the introduction of numerous cloud services. Some of which allow for a governance framework which is partly automated based on the business requirements and the exposed compliance requirements these services have on the business.

The reason for this project is to ensure your governance framework is updated, the infrastructure which it supports updated with the relevant adjustments in policy, compliance and blueprints. To ensure these updates are processed into Governance Framework Update notification automation to meet business requirements.

The comparison between your current secure score and a blueprint initiated secure score and any differences between the two was created in May 2019. This results in possible integration based on the blueprints and the allowed score in your business/company set requirements. A secure implementation of cloud services.

One of the great advantages when using the blueprints is the reduced risk set for the company of not automatically offering the extensive services made available upon launch. The services are first reviewed and allow you to make strategic decisions on what you wish to do when integrating / adopting these services within your company. You will not automatically accept each change in possible solutions which extend far beyond what we currently know understand and see as possible.

To ensure these new services do not conflict with current ongoing production they will not automatically be added to the environment. They will first require adjustment to the governance framework and the blueprints which will control which services by which threshold and type of exposed risk.
