# Zero Trust Maturity Model for Automated Service Releases

## Executive Summary

This Zero Trust Maturity Model provides a comprehensive framework for assessing and advancing organizational capabilities to ensure new releases of services in a production environment are automatically available while maintaining the highest standards of safety and security. The model is built upon six foundational pillars of Zero Trust architecture and provides clear progression paths from initial implementation to optimized automation.

The model aligns with NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture guidelines and integrates seamlessly with our ICT Governance Framework to ensure consistent governance across all technology platforms while enabling secure, automated service delivery.
