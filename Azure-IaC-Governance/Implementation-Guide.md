# Azure Infrastructure as Code Governance Implementation Guide

This document provides comprehensive guidance for implementing Azure governance best practices within the ICT Governance Framework using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose

This implementation guide helps organizations integrate Azure-specific governance practices with their ICT Governance Framework, ensuring consistent governance while leveraging Azure's native capabilities for infrastructure governance.

### Scope

This guide covers:

- Azure-specific governance practices
- Integration with existing ICT governance structures
- Implementation of Infrastructure as Code for Azure resources
- Azure Policy as Code approach
- Drift detection and remediation strategies
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Employee App Store implementation and integration
- SIEM and Cloud App Security integration for shadow IT detection

### Alignment with ICT Governance Framework

This implementation aligns with the three-tiered structure of the ICT Governance Framework:

- **ICT Governance Council (IGC)** - Approves Azure governance standards and policies
- **Technology Domain Owners** - Define Azure-specific governance requirements
- **Technology Stewards** - Implement and maintain Azure governance controls
- **Application Governance Owner** - Oversees application governance including the Employee App Store

## 2. Azure Governance Best Practices

### Infrastructure as Code Principles

Azure governance should follow these key IaC principles:

- **Declarative Over Imperative**: Focus on defining the desired state of infrastructure rather than the steps to create it
- **Native and Industry-Standard Tools**: Leverage Azure-specific tools alongside industry standards
- **Layered IaC Pipelines**: Separate pipelines by deployment frequency (low/medium/high-touch resources)
- **Everything as Code Approach**: Include policies, configurations, documentation, and deployments as code

### Approved IaC Tools

| Tool | Primary Use Case | Governance Application |
|------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Bicep** | Azure-native resources | Primary tool for Azure resources with direct integration to Azure Resource Manager |
| **Terraform** | Multi-cloud deployments | Use for hybrid or multi-cloud scenarios with consistent syntax |
| **ARM Templates** | Legacy Azure resources | For compatibility with existing deployments |
| **Microsoft365DSC** | Microsoft 365 configuration | Extension of governance to SaaS platform |
| **Azure Policy as Code** | Compliance automation | Codifying governance rules as enforceable policies |

## 3. Implementation Architecture

### Azure Resource Organization

```
Management Groups
├── Organization
│   ├── Production (Subscription)
│   │   ├── ResourceGroup1
│   │   └── ResourceGroup2
│   ├── Non-Production (Subscription)
│   │   ├── ResourceGroup1
│   │   └── ResourceGroup2
│   └── Sandbox (Subscription)
│       └── ResourceGroups
```

### Resource Governance Hierarchy

1. **Management Groups**: Organization-wide policies and governance
2. **Subscriptions**: Environment-specific controls and budgets
3. **Resource Groups**: Workload-specific resources with consistent lifecycle
4. **Resources**: Individual Azure services and components

### Tagging Strategy

| Tag Name | Purpose | Example | Required |
|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Owner** | Business owner of the resource | "Finance" | Yes |
| **Environment** | Deployment environment | "Production" | Yes |
| **CostCenter** | Financial allocation | "CC-1234" | Yes |
| **Application** | Associated application | "SAP" | Yes |
| **SecurityLevel** | Security classification | "Restricted" | Yes |
| **ComplianceReq** | Compliance requirements | "PCI,GDPR" | As needed |
| **DataClassification** | Data sensitivity level | "Confidential" | For data resources |

## 4. Azure Policy as Code Implementation

### Policy Definition Structure

```yaml
# Example Policy Structure
name: "Require resource tagging"
description: "Enforce required tags on all resources"
mode: "Indexed"
parameters:
  - requiredTags:
      type: "Array"
      defaultValue: ["Owner", "Environment", "CostCenter"]
policyRule:
  if:
    field: "tags"
    exists: "false"
  then:
    effect: "deny"
```

### Policy Assignment Levels

- **Management Group**: Organization-wide governance policies
- **Subscription**: Environment-specific policies
- **Resource Group**: Workload-specific policies

### Implementation Steps

1. Define policy definitions in code repository
2. Create CI/CD pipelines for policy deployment
3. Implement policy testing and validation
4. Deploy policies with appropriate scoping
5. Monitor policy compliance

## 5. Repository Structure

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline Integration

### Pipeline Stages

```yaml
# Example Azure DevOps Pipeline for Infrastructure Deployment
stages:
  - stage: Validate
    jobs:
      - job: Lint
        steps:
          - script: bicep build **/*.bicep
      - job: Security
        steps:
          - task: AzurePolicy@1
            inputs:
              mode: 'audit'
              
  - stage: PreviewChanges
    jobs:
      - job: WhatIf
        steps:
          - task: AzureResourceManagerTemplateDeployment@3
            inputs:
              deploymentMode: 'Validation'
              whatIf: true
              
  - stage: Deploy
    jobs:
      - job: DeployInfrastructure
        steps:
          - task: AzureResourceManagerTemplateDeployment@3
            inputs:
              deploymentMode: 'Incremental'
              
  - stage: Verify
    jobs:
      - job: ComplianceScan
        steps:
          - task: AzurePolicy@1
            inputs:
              mode: 'audit'
```

### Approval Workflows

Align CI/CD approvals with the ICT Governance Framework:

1. **Low-Risk Changes**: Technology Steward approval
2. **Medium-Risk Changes**: Domain Owner approval
3. **High-Risk Changes**: ICT Governance Council approval

## 7. Drift Detection and Remediation

### Detection Mechanisms

1. **Azure Resource Graph Queries**: 
   - Scheduled queries to compare deployed resources against IaC definitions
   - Alert on unauthorized manual changes

2. **Azure Policy Compliance**:
   - Deploy audit and deny policies enforcing governance standards
   - Generate compliance reports through Azure Policy dashboard

3. **Azure Change Tracking**:
   - Monitor configuration changes to Azure resources
   - Integrate with alert systems for unauthorized changes

### Remediation Process

1. **Automated Remediation**:
   - Implement auto-remediation for policy violations where appropriate
   - Use remediation tasks in Azure Policy

2. **Manual Remediation Workflow**:
   - Generate pull requests for complex remediation needs
   - Document exemptions with justification and expiration

3. **Preventive Controls**:
   - Deploy Deny policies for critical governance requirements
   - Implement just-in-time access for administrative functions

## 8. Governance Metrics and Reporting

### Azure-Specific KPIs

| KPI | Description | Target | Measurement Method |
|-----|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Azure Policy Compliance** | Percentage of resources compliant with Azure policies | >95% | Azure Policy compliance reports |
| **Drift Incident Rate** | Number of configuration drift incidents | <5 per month | Azure Resource Graph queries |
| **IaC Deployment Rate** | Percentage of resources deployed via IaC | >98% | Deployment logs analysis |
| **Resource Tagging Compliance** | Percentage of resources with required tags | 100% | Azure Resource Graph queries |
