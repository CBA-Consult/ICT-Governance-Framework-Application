## Difficult Situation Management

### Managing Challenging Stakeholders

#### The Dominating Participant

**Strategies:**
- Acknowledge their input: "Thank you for that perspective, John..."
- Redirect: "Let's hear from others who haven't spoken yet"
- Set boundaries: "Let's give everyone a chance to contribute"
- Use structured activities: Breakouts limit individual dominance

#### The Silent Stakeholder
**Symptoms:** Doesn't participate, appears disengaged, avoids eye contact
**Strategies:**
- Direct invitation: "Sarah, what's your perspective on this?"

#### The Skeptical Critic
**Symptoms:** Questions everything, focuses on problems, resists ideas
**Strategies:**
- Acknowledge concerns: "You raise important concerns about..."

- Seek solutions: "What would need to change for this to work?"
- Find common ground: "We all want the project to succeed..."

#### The Confused Participant
**Symptoms:** Asks basic questions, seems lost, requests repeated explanations
**Strategies:**

   - "What shared goals can we build from?"
