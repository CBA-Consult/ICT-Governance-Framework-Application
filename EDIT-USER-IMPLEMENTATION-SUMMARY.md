# Edit User Details Functionality - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation and fixes applied to enable and enhance the 'Edit User Details' functionality on the User Management page of the ICT Governance Framework application.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Username Field Issue
**Problem**: The EditUserModal was trying to send the username field to the API, but the backend validation doesn't allow username updates.

**Solution**: 
- Made the username field read-only in the EditUserModal
- Removed username from the API request payload
- Added visual indication that username cannot be changed
- Updated form validation to not require username

### 2. Enhanced Validation
**Problem**: Basic client-side validation was insufficient.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive email format validation using regex
- Added name field validation (letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes only)
- Enhanced error messages for better user experience

### 3. Error Handling
**Problem**: Generic error handling didn't provide specific feedback for different scenarios.

**Solution**:
- Added specific error handling for different HTTP status codes:
  - 409: Email already in use
  - 400: Validation errors with detailed messages
  - 403: Permission denied
  - 404: User not found
  - Network errors
- Enhanced error message display

### 4. User Experience Improvements
**Problem**: Modal behavior and user feedback could be improved.

**Solution**:
- Added form reset functionality when modal is closed
- Added confirmation dialog for status changes that affect user access
- Improved loading states
- Better success message handling

## API Integration

The edit functionality properly integrates with the existing API:

- **PUT /api/users/:userId**: Updates user basic information
