# Shadow IT as Infrastructure Drift: Integration Framework

This document outlines the framework for treating Shadow IT detection as a critical component of infrastructure drift management. By integrating these two traditionally separate processes, organizations can establish a more comprehensive governance approach to technology management.

## 1. Conceptual Framework

### 1.1 Redefining Shadow IT

Shadow IT is traditionally defined as technology implemented without explicit organizational approval. This framework expands this definition to consider Shadow IT as a form of infrastructure drift - a deviation from the approved and governed technology baseline that introduces risks and challenges similar to other forms of infrastructure drift.

### 1.2 Unified Drift Management Approach

Infrastructure drift occurs when the actual state of technology resources diverges from the desired state as defined in:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates
- Configuration management databases (CMDB)
- Approved technology catalogs
- Security baselines
- Governance standards

Shadow IT represents a human-driven form of drift that manifests as unauthorized applications and services appearing in the environment, rather than approved resources changing configuration.

### 1.3 Benefits of Integration

Integrating Shadow IT detection with infrastructure drift management provides several advantages:

- **Unified Governance**: Consistent governance processes for all forms of technology drift
- **Comprehensive Detection**: Improved visibility across all technology domains
- **Streamlined Remediation**: Coordinated response to all forms of drift
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Better understanding of organizational factors driving drift
- **Resource Optimization**: Consolidated tools and processes for drift detection
- **Improved Compliance**: Holistic approach to maintaining compliance baselines

## 2. Detection Framework

### 2.1 Integrated Detection Sources

The following sources should be integrated to provide comprehensive drift detection:

| Detection Source | Primary Function | Shadow IT Role | Integration Point |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Cloud App Security** | SaaS application monitoring | Detect unauthorized cloud applications | API integration with SIEM |
| **SIEM Solutions** | Security event monitoring | Correlate network traffic to identify unknown applications | Central log analysis |
| **Network Monitoring** | Traffic analysis | Identify unusual application traffic patterns | Feed data to SIEM |
| **Configuration Management** | Track infrastructure configuration | Identify unmanaged resources | Integration with CMDB |
| **IAM Systems** | Identity and access management | Detect unauthorized access patterns | Feed authentication data to SIEM |
| **Endpoint Management** | Device configuration and software inventory | Identify unauthorized installed software | Integration with asset management |
| **IaC Validation Tools** | Compare actual vs. defined infrastructure | Identify resources not defined in IaC | Drift detection reporting |

### 2.2 Detection Categories

Detected drift should be categorized consistently across both traditional infrastructure drift and Shadow IT:

1. **Configuration Drift**: Changes to settings of approved resources
2. **Resource Drift**: Addition or removal of resources from the environment
3. **Access Drift**: Changes to who can access resources
4. **Security Drift**: Changes to security controls or posture
5. **Compliance Drift**: Changes affecting regulatory compliance
6. **Application Drift**: Introduction of unapproved applications (Shadow IT)

### 2.3 Unified Alerting Framework

Alert prioritization should use consistent criteria across all drift types:

| Priority | Traditional Drift Example | Shadow IT Example | Response Timeframe |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | Removal of security controls in production | Unauthorized data processing application with PII | Immediate (within hours) |
| **High** | Production configuration changed without approval | Unauthorized admin tool with privileged access | Same business day |
| **Medium** | Development environment changed without documentation | Departmental productivity tool without security review | Within 3 business days |
| **Low** | Minor configuration variance in test environment | Individual productivity tool with limited data access | Within 10 business days |

## 3. Assessment Framework

### 3.1 Unified Assessment Criteria

All forms of drift, including Shadow IT, should be assessed using these dimensions:

1. **Security Impact**: Effect on security posture and risk exposure
2. **Compliance Impact**: Effect on regulatory and policy compliance
3. **Operational Impact**: Effect on stability, performance, and reliability
4. **Business Impact**: Effect on business processes and capabilities
5. **Cost Impact**: Financial implications of the drift
6. **Strategic Alignment**: Alignment with technology strategy and roadmap

### 3.2 Shadow IT Risk Assessment

When Shadow IT is detected, use the [Shadow IT Risk Assessment Template](Shadow-IT-Risk-Assessment-Template.md) to conduct a comprehensive evaluation, incorporating:

- Business justification analysis
- Security risk assessment
- Compliance impact analysis
- Operational considerations
- Cost implications
- Strategic alignment evaluation

### 3.3 Integration with Risk Management

Findings from both traditional drift and Shadow IT assessments should feed into the organizational risk management process:

- Update risk register with new risks
- Evaluate aggregate drift impact
- Track risk trends over time
- Report to appropriate governance bodies

## 4. Remediation Framework

### 4.1 Unified Remediation Approaches

Apply consistent remediation approaches to all drift types:

| Remediation Approach | Traditional Drift Application | Shadow IT Application |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Accept** | Document exception to standard configuration | Register application in approved catalog with restrictions |
| **Remediate** | Bring configuration back to baseline | Implement enterprise version with proper controls |
| **Replace** | Replace with approved alternative | Migrate to approved alternative application |
| **Remove** | Delete non-compliant resource | Uninstall or block unauthorized application |

### 4.2 Governance Decision Framework

Decision-making authority follows a consistent framework:

| Risk Level | Decision Authority | Documentation | Review Cycle |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Low** | Technology Steward | Standard change record | Annual |
| **Medium** | Domain Owner | Exception documentation | Quarterly |
| **High** | Multiple Domain Owners | Risk acceptance documentation | Monthly |
| **Critical** | ICT Governance Council | Formal risk acceptance with mitigation plan | Monthly |

### 4.3 Automated Remediation

Where possible, implement automated remediation for both traditional drift and Shadow IT:

- Self-healing infrastructure for configuration drift
- Automated blocklisting for unauthorized applications
- Workflow automation for approval processes
- Continuous validation and correction

## 5. Prevention Framework

### 5.1 Root Cause Analysis

Analyze patterns in both traditional drift and Shadow IT to identify common root causes:

- Inadequate governance processes
- Insufficient user involvement in technology selection
- Gaps in approved technology capabilities
- Knowledge gaps in proper procedures
- Excessive friction in formal processes

### 5.2 Unified Prevention Strategies

Apply consistent prevention strategies across all drift types:

| Prevention Strategy | Traditional Drift Application | Shadow IT Application |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Education** | Train on infrastructure change management | Train on application request process |
| **Process Improvement** | Streamline change approval | Streamline application approval |
| **Technology Enablement** | Implement drift prevention tools | Implement application controls |
| **Proactive Assessment** | Regular configuration reviews | Regular application usage surveys |
| **User Engagement** | Involve teams in IaC development | Involve users in application selection |
